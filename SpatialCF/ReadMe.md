# CS 54701 Project 3 Spatial Recommendation System.
Spatial information retrieval (SIR) is an extension of the well studied information retrievaltopic which focuses on evaluating a user query and returning documents that satisfy this user's information need. SIR aims to accomplish the same objective but with regard to spatial proximity specied in the query of the user. An increasingly popular technique called collaborative filtering has gained much popularity with the increasing e-commerce applications that drive a personalized experience for the user. Collaborative filtering uses prior data from similar users to suggest possible items that the user has not tried yet. In the same manner we have similar types of recommendation systems for spatial systems today that track multiple users spatiotemporal activity through check-in data via microblog sites such as Twitter and Foursquare.

**Example:** Consider the following scenario where a user is going out on a Saturday night and opens up the app to look for something to do that night. If the user tends to go to clubs on Saturday evenings then that user will probably have other users that do the same thing at the same time. However maybe the other users are in a different part of town and now the user get's noticed of new clubs across town that would have otherwise been unknown to the user.

## Data aggregation

First I needed to obtain and preprocess the data accordingly. My two sources of data are from [Open Street Maps (OSM)](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) data. I believe the primary hurdle in terms of data aggregation and processing would be classifying and labeling areas or clusters of nodes in the OSM data. 
### Failed attempt
It seems like we could get a sense of what a particular node entity was to classify the areas by looking at the "amenity" tag defined in the OSM data. I initially pulled out a vector of all the amenities that showed up in Tippecannoe county and mapped tweets that contained these words onto this vector space using the term frequencies. I performed a K-means clustering with k=8 to try and map amenities to topics. The problem was that the vector space was too small and specific and it seemed I would get most terms clustering in one or two topics. I discussed with 



```python
$ node app
```


# Dillinger

Dillinger is a cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, offline-storage, AngularJS powered HTML5 Markdown editor.

  - Type some Markdown on the left
  - See HTML in the right
  - Magic

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]

> The overriding design goal for Markdown's
> formatting syntax is to make it as readable
> as possible. The idea is that a
> Markdown-formatted document should be
> publishable as-is, as plain text, without
> looking like it's been marked up with tags
> or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Version
3.2.7

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [Marked] - a super fast port of Markdown to JavaScript
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [keymaster.js] - awesome keyboard handler lib by [@thomasfuchs]
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

You need Gulp installed globally:

```sh
$ npm i -g gulp
```

```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] dillinger
$ cd dillinger
$ npm i -d
$ gulp build --prod
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins

* Dropbox
* Github
* Google Drive
* OneDrive

Readmes, how to use them in your own application can be found here:

* [plugins/dropbox/README.md] [PlDb]
* [plugins/github/README.md] [PlGh]
* [plugins/googledrive/README.md] [PlGd]
* [plugins/onedrive/README.md] [PlOd]

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantanously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma start
```

### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 80, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image. 

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t <youruser>/dillinger:latest .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Once done, run the Docker and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 80 of the host to port 80 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 80:80 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:latest
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

### N|Solid and NGINX

More details coming soon.

#### docker-compose.yml

Change the path for the nginx conf mounting path to your full path, not mine!

### Todos

 - Write Tests
 - Rethink Github Save
 - Add Code Comments
 - Add Night Mode
