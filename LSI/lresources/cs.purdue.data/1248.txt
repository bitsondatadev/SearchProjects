The common theme is the investigation of efficient computation in these areas. The goals are to generate improved techniques, and characterize significant complexity relationships. A central issue is the efficient coordination of the acquisition of information during a complex computational task. </BLOCKQUOTE> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
