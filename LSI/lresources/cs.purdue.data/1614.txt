All the attributions below are based on statements made either to me or during a faculty meeting in which the realignment proposal was discussed.</p> <table border="1" align="center" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0"> <tr> <td width="64" align="left" valign="top"><strong>Professor</strong></td> <td width="500" align="left" valign="top"><strong>Comment</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64" align="left" valign="top">P1</td> <td width="500" align="left" valign="top">Why did you not discuss the issue with the faculty during the faculty retreat?<br /> <br /> Engineering is a dying field, why should we move to the College of Engineering?</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64" align="left" valign="top">P2</td> <td width="500" valign="top">I am in favor of CS moving to Engineering but am not supporting the idea because Professor P is in favor. </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64" align="left" valign="top">P3</td> <td width="500" valign="top">If CS moves to Engineering I will not be able to call myself a scientist.<br /> <br /> Faculty was not consulted.</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64" align="left" valign="top">P4</td> <td width="500" valign="top">Why should we move when we are happy here?</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64" align="left" valign="top">P5</td> <td width="500" valign="top"><p>Indeed we are living in luxury, but then why should we let this go?</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64" align="left" valign="top">P6</td> <td width="500" valign="top">I do not believe that our departmental ranking will improve just by moving to Engineering.   </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64" align="left" valign="top">P7</td> <td width="500" valign="top">I am a scientist; I do not wish to be in Engineering.</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64" align="left" valign="top">P8</td> <td width="500" valign="top">I am not in favor of moving to Engineering, but prefer a College of Computing.However, I do not have the time to write a proposal for Purdue to form a College of Computing.</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64" align="left" valign="top">P9</td> <td width="500" valign="top">We are concerned about faculty morale.</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64" align="left" valign="top">P10</td> <td width="500" valign="top">Some ECE faculty members wish to move to CS, then why should we move to Engineering?</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="64" align="left" valign="top">P11</td> <td width="500" valign="top">Your department is “dysfunctional”.
