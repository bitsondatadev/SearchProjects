According to the publisher, &quot;The book addresses new challenges to garbage collection made by recent advances in hardware and software. It explores the consequences of these changes for designers and implementers of high performance garbage collectors. Along with simple and traditional algorithms, the book covers parallel, incremental, concurrent, and real-time garbage collection. Algorithms and concepts are often described with pseudocode and illustrations.&quot;</p> <p class="style1">The book is backed by an extensive <a href=" http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/rej/gcbib/">online bibliography</a> that catalogs over 2,500 garbage-collection related publications and is continuously updated.</p> <p class="style1"><em>The Garbage Collection Handbook: The Art of Automatic Memory Management</em> can be purchased from CRC Press or <a href= http://www.amazon.com/Garbage-Collection-Handbook-Management-Algorithms/dp/1420082795/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1314124017&sr=8-1">Amazon</a>.</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table> </div> </body> </html>
