Starting in 1985, he spent two years as a visiting associate professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the School of Information and Computer Science.<P> Dr. Mathur's research interests are in the area of software testing and reliability. He has been conducting experiments to compare the cost effectiveness and relative strengths of functional, data flow, and mutation testing. He has also been investigating various novel methods for improving the performance of mutation testing. Compiler integrated testing is one such method. He is a member of a new research group on software reliability at Purdue. This group is evaluating existing models for estimating software reliability. The group has also proposed a family of white-box models for accurate prediction of software reliability. Dr. Mathur has authored two well known books: Introduction to Microprocessors and Introduction to Pascal. He is a member of the ACM, IEEE, and TEX User's Group.<P> Projects: <A HREF=AR95Book-78.html>Software Engineering Research Center (SERC)</A>, <A HREF=AR95Book-107.html>Effectiveness and Performance in Software Testing</A>, <A HREF=AR95Book-108.html>White-box Models for the Estimation of Software Reliability</A>, and Program Unification<P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/apm"> Mathur's home page </A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <ADDRESS>CS Annual Report - 19 APR 1996</ADDRESS> <A HREF="AR95Book-34.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bnext.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-32.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bprev.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-6.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bup.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Btop.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bcontent.gif"></A><BR><A HREF="AR95Book-34.html">[Next] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-32.html">[Previous] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-6.html">[Up] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html">[Top] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html">[Contents]</A> <P> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
