Professor Bertino is the 2005 recipient of the IEEE Computer Society Tsutomu Kanai Award. She is recognized with this award for her pioneering, original and innovative research contributions to Secure Distributed Systems.</p> <p class="style2">The Tsutomu Kanai Award is an IEEE technical award that recognizes a major contributor to state-of-the-art distributed computing systems. Created in 1995 with an endowment from Hitachi, Ltd. the recipient of this award is selected by the Board of Governors of the IEEE. It consists of a crystal trophy, a $10,000 honorarium, and travel grants to attend two technical conferences. The award will be presented to Professor Bertino at an awards ceremony in 2006.</p> <p class="style2">Professor Elisa Bertino joined Purdue in January 2004 as professor in Computer Science and research director at CERIAS. Her research interests cover many areas in the fields of information security and database systems. Her research combines both theoretical and practical aspects, addressing applications on a number of domains, such as medicine and humanities. Current research includes: access control systems, secure publishing techniques and secure broadcast for XML data; advanced RBAC models and foundations of access control models; trust negotiation languages and privacy; data mining and security; multi-strategy filtering systems for Web pages and sites; security for grid computing systems; integration of virtual reality techniques and <span class="style2">databases; and geographical information systems and spatial databases.</span></p> <p class="style2">Professor Bertino is a co-editor-in-chief of the VLDB Journal and serves on the editorial boards of several journals - many of which are related to security, such as the ACM Transactions on Information and System Security, the IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Magazine, and the International Journal of Information Security. She is a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and has been recently elected ACM Fellow. She also received the IEEE Computer Society Technical Achievement award in 2002 for outstanding contributions to database systems and database security and advanced data management systems.</p> <p class="style2"><span class="style2">For more information about the Tsutomu Kanai Award visit the <a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/ieeecs/menuitem.c5efb9b8ade9096b8a9ca0108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&pName=ieeecs_level1&path=ieeecs/about/awards&file=TsutomuKanai_recipients.xml&xsl=generic.xsl&" target="_blank">Tsut</a></span><a href="http://www.computer.org/portal/site/ieeecs/menuitem.c5efb9b8ade9096b8a9ca0108bcd45f3/index.jsp?&pName=ieeecs_level1&path=ieeecs/about/awards&file=TsutomuKanai_recipients.xml&xsl=generic.xsl&" target="_blank">omu Kanai Award</a>.
