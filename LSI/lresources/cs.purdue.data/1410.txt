For example, when deciding whom to target with a product offer, it may be helpful to consider whether a person's MySpace or Facebook friends have expressed interest in the product. <p> This tutorial will explore the unique opportunities and challenges for predictive modeling with social network data. We will begin with a description of the problem setting, including examples of various applications of social network mining (e.g., targeted marketing, on-line advertising, fraud detection).  We will then present a number of characteristics of social network data that differentiate it from the traditional settings for inference and learning, and outline the resulting opportunities for significantly improved inference and learning. We will discuss specific techniques for capitalizing on each of the opportunities in statistical models, and outline both methodological issues and potential modeling pathologies that are unique to network data. <p> The focus in this tutorial will be to cover the basics, discuss real applications and results where possible, and provide a framework for understanding the more advanced concepts.  We also will provide supplemental material on more advanced concepts, including links to the recent literature. <p> Prerequisites: The tutorial assumes a basic knowledge of AI-style inference and machine learning, equivalent to an introductory graduate or advanced undergraduate class. <br> <p> <a href="snm-icwsm09.pdf"><b>SLIDES</b></a> <p> <a href="snm-icwsm09-resources.pdf"><b>Additional Resources</b></a> <br> <br> <p> <b>OUTLINE</b> <ol> <li> Introduction to social network mining. <br> Illustration of various social network mining tasks with real-world examples.
