Once data was entered, we wanted to provide a facility for storing and retrieving the information. <br><br> The project broke down into three main parts. Before that, we wanted to model the Visual Studio-style form in XML to allow for a dynamic creation. This required us to design an XML schema that could describe the controls that we would place on said form. Once the schema was described, we needed an application that would render this XML. This was the first task: The Renderer. Once complete, we realized that modeling the form in XML required a fairly advanced knowledge of XML and of Visual Studio, which our target customer would not have. Thus, we designed our Form Designer that would allow a GUI-style creation of the XML form, and then generate the XML for the user. The last piece of our project consisted of being able to store and retrieve data entered into the form. We did this by creating a database in XML that would pull a schema from the form description's XML.<br><br> A large portion of our project was to allow for expandability and dynamics. To this effect, with the Form Builder, we wrote a set of API that, if implemented, will render any custom controls that might be needed with minimal effort. We package a small set of these custom controls: ink boxes for tables, speech recognition, and a custom grid control. For the database, even though we implemented an XML database, we also wrote a set of API and could potentially be used to create a SQL interface, a CSV (comma-separated values) interface, or even an RTF (rich-text format) interface. </div> <div id="nsbanner"> <div id="TitleRow"> <h1 class="dtH1">Project Members</h1> </div> </div> <div id="nstext"> <ul> <li>Mike Griffin <li>Sapan Shah <li>James Stapleton <li><a href="forms4.jpg">Team Photo</a> From left to right: Mike, Sapan, James </ul> </div> <div id="nsbanner"> <div id="TitleRow"> <h1 class="dtH1">Project Documentation and Usermanual</h1> </div> </div> <div id="nstext"> <ul> <li><a href="Documentation">Code Documentation</a> <li><a href="Documentation/Documentation.chm">Downloadable Code Documentation</a> <li><a href="usersmanual.doc">User manual</a> </ul> </div> <div id="nsbanner"> <div id="TitleRow"> <h1 class="dtH1">Downloads -- Souce code, executable, Installer, and Presentation files</h1> </div> </div> <div id="nstext"> <ul> <li><a href="PaperlessOfficeSource.zip">Source Code</a> <li><a href="Paperless Office.msi">Installer</a> <li><a href="Health PC Presentation.ppt">Project Presentation</a> </ul> </div> <div id="nsbanner"> <div id="TitleRow"> <h1 class="dtH1">Installation Instructions</h1> </div> </div> <div id="nstext"> Running the binary: <ol> <li>Download The HeathPC Installer <li>Run the HealthPC Installer <li>Follow the on screen instructions <li>Run the program from the start menu or where you installed it to <li>See user manual on how to use the program </ol> Using the Source: <ol> <li>Download the HealthPC Source Code zip file <li>Unzip source to a directory on your local computer drive <li>In the main Project directory double click on the Paperless Office Solution File <li>See Code Documention on how to compile the code. </ol> </div> <div id="nsbanner"> <div id="TitleRow"> <h1 class="dtH1">Special Thanks to</h1> </div> </div> <div id="nstext"> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/grr">Professor Gustavo Rodriguez-Rivera</a> <li><a href="http://people.nursing.purdue.edu/~kchang/">Professor Karen Chang</a> <li>The <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu">CS Department</a> for allowing us to take the class and for borrowing the tablet PCs </ul> </div> </body> </html> </html>
