I expect it to become the standard textbook on the subject.'' <BR><BR> <UL><UL><UL> - Craig Partridge, Chairman of ACM SIGCOMM </UL></UL></UL> <BR><BR> ``Professor Comer has done it again. This is another comprehensive book from him *- this time on designing network systems with a specific focus on the emerging area of network processors. Engineers and students will definitely find this book valuable.'' <BR><BR> <UL><UL><UL> - T. Sridhar, FutureSoft </UL></UL></UL> <BR><BR> ``This book is required reading for anyone who wants to understand what goes on inside the plethora of magic boxes that make the Internet work.'' <BR><BR> <UL><UL><UL> - Larry Peterson, Princeton University </UL></UL></UL> <BR><BR> ``The author shows an amazing understanding of the subtle issues.'' <BR><BR> <UL><UL><UL> - Paul Schmitt, Calix Incorporated </UL></UL></UL> <BR><BR> ``This book is excellent: clearly written, easy to understand, and comprehensive.'' <BR><BR> <UL><UL><UL> - John Lin, Bell Labs </UL></UL></UL> <BR><BR> ``<em>Network Systems Design Using Network Processors</em> is the right book at the right time. Upon seeing the book, friends who have recently entered the field of network processors invariably say something like, `I wish I'd had this book nine months ago!' It is an excellent fusion of network processing design principles, current architectures, and architectural directions. It is sure to become the standard text for this field the minute it hits the shelves.'' <BR><BR> <UL><UL><UL> - Dale Parson, Agere Systems </UL></UL></UL> <BR><BR> ``Comer discusses all of the crucial architectural and economic decisions that drive modern network systems design today. <em>Network Systems Design</em> will be extremely helpful to engineers building those systems, as well as anyone interested in understanding how they work.'' <BR><BR> <UL><UL><UL> - Paul Phillips, Nauticus Networks </UL></UL></UL> <BR> <BR> <H4><A HREF="netbooks.html#nsd">Return to list of Comer's networking books</A></H4> <BR> <H4><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/comer">Return to Comer's homepage</A></H4> </HTML> </HTML>
