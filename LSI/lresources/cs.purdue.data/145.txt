The leadership team that organizes most activities is made up of students who want to reach out and help all of the women in CS. <br /><br /> CSWN organizes different activities meant to encourage young women to meet one another and also learn more about their chosen field of study. These activities range from picnics to technical talks to helping students find tutors if they are needed. <br /><br /> Our goal is to encourage women in computer science to stay in the field and prosper. </p> <div class="headline">Upcoming Events</div> <!-- This iframe below is a link to the CSWN google calendar, make sure it is correctly updated.
