The couple will perform as part of the <a href="http://www.getalifemb.org/" target="_blank">Get a Life (GAL) adult marching band</a> of Portland, Oregon. Steve will lead the band as well as perform on tenor sax, and Janet will play her alto sax for the event. The band, comprised of members who range in age from 20's to 60's, have three things in common. GAL Founder and Executive Director Bob Pulido notes, &ldquo;We were all in high school or college marching bands; we still haven't gotten over it; and we'd rather miss a note than a meal!&rdquo;</font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><a href="1-6-09tolopkainauguration.pdf" target="_blank">GAL was chosen by the Presidential Inaugural Committee</a> from over 1300 applications as a substitute for a band that dropped out of the parade. Amid no vacancies and transportation shortages, the group enthusiastically plans their trip to the capital. They will be staying in Philadelphia and commuting by bus to DC on Inauguration Day.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congratulations to the Tolopka's and the rest of the GAL Marching Band!</font></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> </table> </body> </html> </html>
