The RAID (Robust and Adaptable Distributed Database) System has been operational since the summer of 1987. In addition several systems: O-RAID (Object), P-RAID (Parallel), Mini-RAID, and PUSH (OS/DBMS) are available. Recently WANCE (Wide Area Network Communication Emulation) tool, several benchmarks for experiments, and a simulated distributed system have become available. The software developed at Purdue consists of over 100,000 lines of code written in the C programming language that executes on the UNIX operating system. The RAID laboratory has provided an environment for testing algorithms, conducting experiments, and implementing new ideas. The implementation is being carried out on a network of nine Sun workstations. The laboratory has been fully equipped and staffed by external funds from AT&amp;T, NASA, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Department of Transportation, and UNISYS Corporation.<P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <ADDRESS>CS Annual Report - 19 APR 1996</ADDRESS> <A HREF="AR95Book-57.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bnext.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-55.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bprev.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-48.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bup.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Btop.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bcontent.gif"></A><BR><A HREF="AR95Book-57.html">[Next] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-55.html">[Previous] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-48.html">[Up] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html">[Top] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html">[Contents]</A> <P> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
