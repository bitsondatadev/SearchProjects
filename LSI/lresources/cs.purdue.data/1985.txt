Marinescu</a><p> Sponsor: NSF<P> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%><p> EMMA is an interactive graphics package for digital image processing of electron micrographs. It includes the Crosspoint Method for automatic detection of particle images in electron micrographs and a number of traditional image processing methods. EMMA consists of: (a) A Graphical User Interface (GUI), (b) an I/O module responsible for reading/writing files, for input data format recognition, for conversion between data formats, and for handling I/O errors, (c) A processing module which provides capabilities for various image transforms, correlation, and automatic particle detection. (c) A display module, which allows the user to display images, cut and record subimages, shrink and zoom images. <p> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> </body> </html> </html>
