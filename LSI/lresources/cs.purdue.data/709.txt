Geometric constraint solvers are a key component in modern Mechanical Computer-Aided Design systems. The primary applications are assembly design, geometric tolerancing, and conceptual design. Developing an effective spatial solver calls for research in symbolic and numerical computing based upon a thorough understanding of the engineering applications. The research integrates deep algebraic results, powerful numerical algorithms, and sophisticated graphical tools for visualizing complicated geometric systems. <P> <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
