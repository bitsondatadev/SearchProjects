Of particular interest to him is the algorithm/software/resource selection problem which is very important in numerical computation, cryptography, data compression, scheduling, game playing, and other areas of computer science. For domains in scientific computing, he has developed a general methodology for this problem borrowing relevant information from data mining and numerical analysis. This work has led to a recommender system (PYTHIA) that supports PSEs such as ELLPACK, //ELLPACK and interfaces with a mathematical software repository <A href="http://gams.nist.gov">(http://gams.nist.gov)</a> on the World Wide Web. <p> He is also active in agent based systems for multidisciplinary problem solving, computational models for short term prediction and other problems that lie at the intersection of artificial intelligence and computational science. Dr. Ramakrishnan is a member of the IEEE, the IEEE Computer Society, ACM, ACM SIGART, and Upsilon Pi Epsilon. <p> <i>Projects:</i> <ul> <li> <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/mpse.html"> Multidisciplinary Problem Solving Environments</a> <li> <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse/pythia"> PYTHIA: Using Computational Intelligence to Support Problem Solving Environments</a> </ul> <P> <A HREF="../publications/ramakris.html">Recent Publications</A> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ramakris"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
