Peterson</a> is among 86 newly elected members of the National Academy of Engineering (<a href="http://www.nae.edu/">NAE</a>).&nbsp; Peterson was elected based on his contributions to the design, implementation and deployment of networked software systems.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> Election to the National Academy of Engineering is among the highest professional distinctions accorded to an engineer. Academy membership honors those who have made outstanding contributions to &quot;engineering research, practice, or education, including, where appropriate, significant contributions to the engineering literature,&quot; and to the &quot;pioneering of new and developing fields of technology, making major advancements in traditional fields of engineering, or developing/implementing innovative approaches to engineering education.&quot; <br /> <br /> Peterson received his PhD in Computer Science from Purdue University in 1985.&nbsp; He is currently the Robert E. Kahn Professor of Computer Science at Princeton University and Director of the Princeton-hosted PlanetLab Consortium.&nbsp; <br /> <br /> Congratulations, Dr. Peterson for this great honor!</p></td> </tr> </table> </body> </html> </html>
