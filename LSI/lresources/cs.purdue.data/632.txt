They were motivated to create a fun program using an &quot;intuitive user interface&quot; with &quot;powerful features.&quot; Their presentation showed that users can easily create a character, paint it, pose it and animate it with only one pen. </p> <p class="style1"> <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><img src="images/490Twater.jpg" width="204" height="161" align="right"></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><br> <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/aliaga/cs490t/wworld-slides.pdf" target="_blank">Water World Presentation</a><br> <br> </strong></strong> Craig Topper, Anthony Burke, and Jeremy Milonas joined their puppeteering classmates on Demo Day with their island simulator. They presented their &quot;Water World&quot; model, &quot;a model that generally characterized an island&quot; surrounded by &quot;a large body of moving water.&quot; They also discussed the challenges, approaches, and results of creating the graphical representation of water and land both. <strong><br> <br> <br> <strong><img src="images/490thouse.jpg" width="208" height="152" align="right"></strong><a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/aliaga/cs490t/sketch-slides.pdf" target="_blank">Sketch Presentation</a></strong></p> <p class="style1">Team Giab, consisting of Barron Gillon and Lee Chang, were then quick to jump into the mix of projects with their 3D sketcher. Their project explored the simplification of sketching controls to make the process feasible using a Tablet PC. They presented this by showing examples of complex sketching software and Tablet specific software.</p> <p class="style1"> <strong><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><br> <strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><img src="images/490Tori.jpg" width="208" height="142" align="right"></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/aliaga/cs490t/ori-slides.pdf" target="_blank">Ori Presentation</a><br> <br> </strong></strong><strong><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></strong><strong><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>Tim Thirion, Darin Rajan, and Jennifer Lin then <strong><strong><strong><strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>wowed the crowd with an interactive paper folding simulation. The objective of their programming adventure was to create a system that allows the user &quot;to create simple, 3D origami objects using an intuitive interface&quot; and &quot;to design a system such that basic folds are immediately available and complex folds can be added.&quot; <strong><br> </strong><br> <br> <strong><img src="images/490Tmonster-ink.jpg" width="205" height="146" align="right"><a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/aliaga/cs490t/monster-ink-slides.pdf" target="_blank">Monster Ink Presentation</a></strong><br> <br> Bringing it all to a close, Jason Dean and Heather O'Cull had a screaming good time with their demonstration of a sketcher that allows a three dimensional foreground atop a two dimensional background. Their goal was &quot;to design an easy to use scenery sketcher where the user can draw a flat background and 3D objects. The user is then able to add creatures that perform actions.&quot; </p> <p class="style1"><br> Students were advised to use C++ as the implementation language, GLUT/OpenGL for graphics and WinMFC or GLUI for user interfaces.&nbsp; Projects can be built using existing code that is available or can be downloaded.<strong> </strong></p> </div></td> </tr> </table> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
