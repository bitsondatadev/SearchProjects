For example, a student may be asked to read all the basic papers, a textbook on cryptography, and a number of (e.g., five) additional papers. These additional papers may be chosen from the list of advanced papers or assigned by the exam committee.&nbsp; To which extent this list is used for a particular exam is completely up to the exam committee to decide. </P> <p> The list of basic papers are also recommended for any graduate student who plan to conduct research in security.&nbsp; The list of advanced papers are recommended for students who wish to know more about particular research areas in security.</p> <p>We have copies of some papers that are not available online. These papers are kept in REC 217. Ask the receptionist in REC 217 for the "Security Qual2 Readings" folder, make copies of the papers you need, and return the folder. </p> <p>Comments and suggestions are welcome.&nbsp; Please send them to ninghui@cs.purdue.edu</p> <!-- <li> We don't attempt to provide a <I>comprehensive</I> list of fundamental papers in information security.&nbsp; We will include a paper only if it adds significant additional value to the two beginning graduate security courses we have (CS 526 and CS 555).&nbsp; Sometimes we include a paper even if the courses do cover the main topics in the paper, because we feel that reading the original paper nonetheless will be very beneficial to the students.</li> <li> The paper selection is inevitably subjective. Some may argue that some of the papers we choose are not as fundamental as others.&nbsp; We feel that these papers cover useful information that a graduate student working in security should know.</li> --> <h2>Basic Papers</h2> <ol> <li>W.
