His research interests span the areas of scientific computing, parallel algorithms, applications, and architectures. His recent work has been in the areas of dense hierarchical solvers and preconditioners for boundary element methods and particle dynamics. These find applications in electromagnetic scattering, circuit simulations, vorticity methods for fluid flows, and n-body applications in astrophysics and molecular dynamics. Using a piecewise basis for expansion of potentials, he has developed accelerated multipole techniques, parallel formulations, and their applications in solving dense linear systems. <P> In addition to these, Prof. Grama has also been working on other projects on parallel processing of data-mining problems, models for parallel programming, performance evaluation of parallel systems, and parallel architectures. He has published several articles on these topics, and has co-authored a text <i>Introduction to Parallel Computing</i>, Benjamin Cummings/Addison Wesley, 1994. Prof. Grama is a member of Sigma Xi. <P> <i>Projects:</i> <UL> <li> <A HREF="/research/phanbp.html"> Parallel Hierarchical Algorithms for n-Body Problems <li> <A HREF="/research/cmvd.html"> Computational Methods in VLSI Design <li> <A HREF="/research/hpcadam.html"> High Performance Computing Applications in Data Analysis and Mining </UL> <P> <A HREF="../publications/ayg.html">Recent Publications</a> <P> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/ayg"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
