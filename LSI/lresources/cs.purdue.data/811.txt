Darmstadt. During the Summer of 1985, he was a visiting professor at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, New York and in the Summer of 1993 he was a visiting scientist at the Scalable Systems Division of Intel. His research interests cover real-time systems, computer networks, performance evaluation of computer and communication systems, parallel and distributed systems, and scientific computing.<P> Dr. Marinescu was the chief architect of a real-time data acquisition and analysis system used in experiments leading to the discovery of the superheavy elements; maituerium, hessium, and ni ls borium. He is currently leading a project in computational biology processed on the development of parallel algorithms and methods for the 3-D atomic structure deterioration of large macromolecules like viruses. He is also involved in the Scalable I/O Initiative.<P> Projects: <A HREF=AR95Book-104.html>Parallel Algorithms and Methods for Solving Macromolecular Structures</A>, <A HREF=AR95Book-105.html>Parallel and Distributed Computing for Solving Very Large Structural Biology Problems</A>, <A HREF=AR95Book-106.html>The Study of the Paging and I/O Activity of Parallel Programs</A><P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/dcm"> Marinescu's home page</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <ADDRESS>CS Annual Report - 19 APR 1996</ADDRESS> <A HREF="AR95Book-33.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bnext.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-31.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bprev.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-6.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bup.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Btop.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bcontent.gif"></A><BR><A HREF="AR95Book-33.html">[Next] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-31.html">[Previous] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-6.html">[Up] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html">[Top] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html">[Contents]</A> <P> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
