The Diamond Award is given to a student (grad or undergrad) who has recently graduated or will graduate soon. The award is intended to recognize a student who has made the most impressive transformation as a CERIAS student -- metaphorically, from "coal" to "diamond," leaving Purdue as a "shining example."</p> <p class="style1">Ashish was an advisee of Prof. Elisa Bertino. His research interests are broadly in the area of “how to build secure and dependable systems and services”. In his doctoral thesis, Ashish addressed the problem of “How to Authenticate Trees and Graphs Without Leaking”. One of his papers related to his thesis received the Best Student Paper at the IEEE Enterprise Computing conference in 2006.</p> <p class="style1">Prior to joining Purdue, Ashish was a Research Staff Member at IBM India Research Lab for about five years. At IBM Research, he worked on distributed and pervasive systems. He has been (co-)inventor in several patents. He has also been awarded with the IBM Bravo award as well as two IBM Plateau awards for his contributions.He is currently working at IBM T J Watson Research Center.</p> <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p> <p class="style1">Source: <a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/site/news/view/researchers_students_receive_awards_at_the_2011_cerias_symposium/">CERIAS</a></p> <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table> </div> </body> </html> </html>
