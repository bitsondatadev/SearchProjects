It contains work areas with 20 Intel Pentium PCs. The Intel Pentium workstations run the Solaris operating system and provide a conventional computing environment. A SPARC file server dedicated to the lab provides an additional 2 GB of disk storage. <P> There are also 15 "back-end" Intel Pentium PCs in the lab reserved for running the Xinu operating system. These machines are controlled by a distributed access/downloader system that allows anyone logged in at any machine to request back-end resources and download programs into them for debugging and testing. <P> Several Intel Pentium Workstations and Sun SPARCstations are dedicated to the Xinu project providing additional support for experimentation with heterogeneous machines and disk space for remote file systems and paging. <P> All machines in the Xinu lab connect to an Ethernet that is connected through a gateway to the Internet backbone. Thus, the machines have connectivity to other universities and research labs throughout the country. <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <ADDRESS>CS Annual Report - 19 APR 1996</ADDRESS> <A HREF="AR95Book-61.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bnext.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-59.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bprev.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-48.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bup.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Btop.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bcontent.gif"></A><BR><A HREF="AR95Book-61.html">[Next] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-59.html">[Previous] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-48.html">[Up] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html">[Top] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html">[Contents]</A> <P> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
