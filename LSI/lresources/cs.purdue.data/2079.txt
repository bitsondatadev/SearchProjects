These systems will provide accurate computer simulations of physical objects coupled with powerful design optimization tools to allow prototyping and final design of a broad range of items. <P> It is recognized that the design of physical systems is an iterative process where typically the geometry of the frames is modified, perhaps often. This is the result of some design optimization with respect to some static or dynamic criteria. Creating modeling systems whose geometry changes with time is a challenging problem that is impossible to solve without some ``intelligent'' support from the software components of the system. <P> It has been observed that the design and simulation of complex physical systems is a very computationally intensive process that requires massive computational power. It is known that realistic 3-D problems cannot be accurately modeled by existing computers. Thus, it is necessary to implement Electronic Prototyping for Physical Object Design (EPPOD) systems on massively parallel hardware platforms. <P> This project has the following two main thrusts: <UL> <LI> Development of ``Smart'' Problem Solving Environments for Electronic Prototyping for Physical Object Design (EPPOD) <LI> Development of High Performance Scalable Algorithmic Infrastructure for Solving PDES </UL> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
