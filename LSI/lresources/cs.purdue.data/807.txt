The foundation enables researchers from all over the world at different stages in their careers to spend time researching in Germany. Eugster will be compiling his research at the Technical University of Darmstadt. </p> <p class="style1">The research conducted by Professor Eugster will focus on a novel software development methodology called Event-Oriented Software Development (EOSD). Eugster says that "current methodologies are centered around applications executing on single devices, offering insufficient support for many distributed reactive applications developed nowadays for execution across multiple hosts. EOSD shifts the focus away from individual components to exchanges between them, thus simplifying their composition as well as global reasoning about such applications."</p> <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p> <p class="style1">For more information on the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, <a href="http://www.humboldt-foundation.de/web/about-us.html">visit their site</a>. </p> <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table> </div> </body> </html> </html>
