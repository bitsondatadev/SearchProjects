<HEAD> <TITLE>Video Database Systems</TITLE> </HEAD> <BODY> <H2>Video Database Systems</H2> <P> Principal Investigator: Ahmed K. Elmagarmid <P> Research Assistants: H. Jiang, M. Hammad, J. Huang <P> Sponsors: Intel, IBM, PRF <P> A video database management system can be defined as a software system that manages a collection of video data and provides content-based access to users. In this project we address the following important issues: <OL> <li> Video data modeling deals with the issue of representing the video data, that is, designing the high-level abstraction of the raw video to facilitate various operations. These operations include video data insertion, editing, indexing, browsing, and querying. <li> Video data insertion deals with the issue of introducing new video data into a video database. This usually includes following steps: 1) Key information (or features) extraction from video data for instantiating a data model; 2) Video scene analysis and segmentation; 3) Video annotation; 4) Index and store video data into the video database based on the extracted information and the annotated information about video data. <li> Video data query and retrieval deals with the extraction of video data from the database that satisfies certain user-specified query conditions. Due to the nature of video data, those query conditions are usually ambiguous in that the video data satisfying the query condition are not unique. <li> A prototype system allowing users to perform video queries based on semantic content and spatio-temporal characteristics has been built. Using this system, users can also efficiently browse video databases using video hyperlinks. </OL> <P> <FONT COLOR="#ce9c33" SIZE="-1"> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/ar98" TARGET="_top"> <CENTER> 1998 <BR> Annual Research Report</A> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu" TARGET="_top">Department of <BR> Computer Sciences</A> </CENTER> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
