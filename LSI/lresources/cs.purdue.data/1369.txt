I generally prefer to answer questions about the class in person, either during my office hours or in the classroom, because (i) the communication bandwidth is better than email; (ii) I have trouble typing due to an RSI problem with my hands; and (iii) others may benefit from the answer. </PRE> <H3> * Please add yourself to the cs580 mailing list </H3> <PRE> ... by typing "mailer add me to cs580" and hitting RETURN on a CS machine (if you don't have a CS account just drop the TA an email note and he will add you to the list). Please use your Purdue email address for this list and for all emails about this class. </PRE> <H3> <A HREF="hwks/sampleexamquestions.pdf">Examples of midterm and final exam questions</A> </H3> <H3> <A HREF="hwks/qualexamplequestions.pdf">Examples of PhD supplemental qual exam questions</A> </H3> --> <H3> <A HREF="hwks/midsol.pdf">Solution to midterm</A> </H3> <H3> <A HREF="hwks/inclasssol.pdf">Solution to in-class exam</A> </H3> <PRE> Typo was fixed at 11:19pm on Thursday Dec 8 (re-download if you had downloaded it earlier) </PRE> <H3> Midterm exam grade statistics: </H3> <PRE> Average: 76.5 Median: 75.5 Maximum: 97 Minimum 46 Standard Deviation: 12.72 </PRE> </BODY></HTML> </BODY></HTML>
