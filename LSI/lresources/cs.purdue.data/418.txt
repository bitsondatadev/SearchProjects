His recent work deals with algorithms and data structures for combinatorial pattern matching problem as arising in text editing, data compression, picture processing, biomolecular sequence analysis, etc. He is a coeditor (with Z. Galil) of the books <i>Combinatorial Algorithms on Words</i> (Springer-Verlag) and <i>Pattern Matching Algorithms</i> (Oxford Univ. Press), serves on the editorial boards of <i>Parallel Processing Letters</i>, <i>Theoretical Computer Science, Journal of Computational Biology, Chaos Theory and Applications</i>, and was guest editor for a special issue of <i>Algorithmica</i> on string algorithms and their applications.<BR> He also serves on the steering committee of the <I>International Symposia on Combinatorial Pattern Matching</I>, the Proceedings of which he co-edited in 1993, 1994, and 1997 on the executive committees of the <I>Fibonacci Institute for the Foundations of Computer Science</I> and of the <I>MSE Program in Software Engineering</I>. He has served on the program committees of many international conferences, most recently, the <I>International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming</I>, the <I>IEEE Data Compression Conference</I>, the <I>IFIP Conference on Parallel Algorithms for Irregularly Structured Problems</I>, the <I> Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures</I>, etc., and as an invited speaker at various international conferences and advanced schools. <P> <i>Projects:</i> <ul> <li> <A HREF="../research/alcomispama.html">Algorithmic and Combinatorial Issues in Pattern Matching</a> </ul> <P> <A HREF="../publications/axa.html">Recent Publications</a> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/axa"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
