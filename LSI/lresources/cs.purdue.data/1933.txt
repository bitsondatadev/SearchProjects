Darmstadt. During the Summer of 1985, he was a visiting professor at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, New York and in the Summer of 1993 he was a visiting scientist at the Scalable Systems Division of Intel. His research interests cover real-time systems, computer networks, performance evaluation of computer and communication systems, parallel and distributed systems, and scientific computing. <P> Dr. Marinescu was the chief architect of a real-time data acquisition and analysis system used in experiments leading to the discovery of the superheavy elements; meitnerium, hessium, and nielsbohrium. He is currently leading a project in computational biology processed on the development of parallel algorithms and methods for the 3-D atomic structure deterioration of large macromolecules like viruses. He is also involved in the Scalable I/O Initiative. </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
