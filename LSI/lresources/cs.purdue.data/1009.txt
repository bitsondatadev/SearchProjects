This equation arises, for example, in the following context: An integer valued random variable <IMG WIDTH=18 HEIGHT=25 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="img5.gif" > is transformed into the probability generating function <IMG WIDTH=118 HEIGHT=31 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="img6.gif" > as an intermediate step in obtaining the Poisson transform <IMG WIDTH=210 HEIGHT=34 ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="img7.gif" > that satisfies the above equation. The Poisson version of the problem replaces the deterministic input <I>n</I> by a Poisson variable <I>N</I> with mean <I>z</I> = <I>n</I>. Such a <I>poissonization</I> is often useful since it leads to a simpler solution (due to some unique properties of the Poisson process). In this research we aim at providing an asymptotic solution of the above (and others) differential-functional equation for <IMG WIDTH=51 HEIGHT=8 ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="img8.gif" > in a cone around real axis. This leads to a solution of the problem at hand within the Poisson model framework. To translate it into the original model one needs (subtle) <I> depoissonization</I> results that are our second topic of the proposed research. Most of our depoissonization findings fall into the following general scheme: <I>if the Poisson transform is appropriately bounded in a cone around the real axis and does not grow too fast outside such a cone, then one can asymptotically depoissonize by replacing the Poisson process by its mean.</I> Not unexpectedly, actual formulations of depoissonization depend on the nature of the bound, and thus we shall investigate <I>diagonal</I> depoissonization theorems. Finally, we apply our results to a variety of challenging problems on words arising in pattern matching, data compression, security, cryptology, coding, molecular biology, and so forth. <P> <IMG SRC="/research/goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
