Our work involves multi-disciplinary efforts to find new tools and technologies to make computing and networks more trustworthy. We are investigating approaches that can be applied immediately and cost-effectively, and that will work in a wide variety of commercial legacy systems. Our sponsors provide feedback and direction, as well as beta sites for testing prototypes and gathering research data. <p> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> </body> </html> </html>
