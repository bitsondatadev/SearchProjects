The ActiveMap program would then act as a tour-guide, displaying information pertinent to the user's current location. ActiveMap should also show where the user is located on a map, and even where other tablet users are located. <br/><br/> To accomplish the location-awareness, we used medium and long-range RFID (radio frequency identification) tags, and an RFID-reader card in the TabletPC. When in "tour-mode", the ActiveMap program continously scans for the nearest RFID tag. When the RFID tag changes, the corresponding location is looked up in a static database already loaded onto the tablet and the displayed information is updated accordingly. Also when the nearest tag changes, a remote server is notified. This server, called the "presence server", keeps track of the current location of all current ActiveMap users. The ActiveMap program provides this list to each tablet, which allows it to display the location and name of each tablet user on a map. <br/><br/> The map itself is implemented using Adobe SVG, a common format for showing dynamic vector-based content on the web. We create a base SVG map that contains all the hooks needed by our program using a map converter we wrote. The ActiveMap program then dynamically modifies the DOM-tree of the SVG to show the current location of the user and the location of other users. <br/><br/> In addition to the basic features described above, we also implemented some fun things like voice recognition. If you're walking around the Computer Science building looking for a certain professor's office, you can just say "Computer, locate Professor X's office" and reply with a voice telling you it's location. The location on the map will also show up in blue. <br/><br/><br/> <b>ActiveMap Screenshots:</b> <br/> <br/> <table rows="2" columns="3" width="100%"> <tr> <td> <center> <a href="images/portrait2.jpg"><img width="100" border="1" src="images/portrait2.jpg"/></a> <br/> Gustavo's Office<br/> Portrait Mode<br/> Small Map </center> </td> <td> <center> <a href="images/portrait1.jpg"><img width="100" border="1" src="images/portrait1.jpg"/></a> <br/> Szpankowski's Office<br/> Portrait Mode<br/> Small Map </center> </td> <td> <center> <a href="images/screen1.jpg"><img height="100" border="1" src="images/screen1.jpg"/></a> <br/> CS 175<br/> Landscape<br/> Small Map </center> </td> <td> <center> <a href="images/screen2.jpg"><img height="100" border="1" src="images/screen2.jpg"/></a> <br/> CS 175<br/> Landscape<br/> Expanded Map </center> </td> </tr> </table> </p> <br/> <div class="title">ActiveMap Features List</div> <ul> <li>Long-range RFID based location awareness <li>Web driven content engine <ul> <li>Use existing tools to produce Web content <li>Limitless possibilities <li>Send commands to ActiveMap through the HTML </ul> <li>Dynamic maps using Adobe SVG <ul> <li>Vector-based, scaleable to any size <li>Dynamically shows your location <li>Dynamically shows location of others <li>Generated from custom Purdue map format </ul> <li>Voice recognition/synthesis <ul> <li>Welcome message when switching rooms <li>Voice-based navigtation: "Computer, locate ....?" </ul> <li>Designed for Tablet PC <ul> <li>Very little text input <li>Map designed for simple point-and-click navigation <li>No small, hard to hit controls <li>Web content ideal for tablet's portrait mode <li>Voice recognition allows hands-free control </ul> <li> Open-Source <ul> <li>All code is available below </ul> </ul> <br/> <div class="title">Final Presentation / Demo</div> <p> At the end of the semester, we demoed our project to several professors and administrators from Purdue. Although the demo was not video-taped, the PowerPoint presentation we used is available. It outlines the basic architecture of ActiveMap's design and lists many of the features. <br/><br/> Our demo showed the ActiveMap in use in the Purdue Computer Science building. To do this, we needed to create web content for ActiveMap. While incomplete and only meant for the demo, you can still browse through it. <ul> <li><a href="downloads/ActiveMapPresentation.ppt">Download the PowerPoint presentation</a> (792 KB) <li><a href="content/locations">Browse web-content made for demo</a> </ul> </p> <br/> <div class="title">Installation</div> <p> We've created an installer to install the ActiveMap client program and any needed libraries.
