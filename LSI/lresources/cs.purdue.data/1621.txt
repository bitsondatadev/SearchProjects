Any other topic we agree upon! </UL> <H2>Here are some sample projects from the latest semesters of CS 536 and CS 638 offerings </H2> <UL> <LI>Jeff Seibert, David Zage, Sonia Fahmy, Cristina Nita-Rotaru, &quot;Experimental Comparison of Peer-to-Peer Streaming Overlays: An Application Perspective,&quot; In Proceedings of the 33rd Annual IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN), 8 pp., October 2008. <LI>Mohit Saxena, Umang Sharan, Sonia Fahmy, &quot;Analyzing Video Services in Web 2.0: A Global Perspective,&quot; In Proceedings of the 18th ACM International Workshop on Network and Operating Systems Support for Digital Audio and Video (NOSSDAV), 6 pp., May 2008. <LI> Dimitrios Koutsonikolas, Jagadeesh Dyaberi, Prashant Garimella, Sonia Fahmy, Y. Charlie Hu, &quot;On TCP Throughput and Window Size in a Multihop Wireless Network Testbed,&quot; In Proceedings of the Second ACM International Workshop on Wireless Network Testbeds, Experimental evaluation and CHaracterization (WiNTECH), in conjunction with ACM MobiCom, 8 pp., September 2007. <LI> Roman Chertov and Sonia Fahmy, &quot;Optimistic Load Balancing in a Distributed Virtual Environment,&quot; In Proceedings of the 16th ACM International Workshop on Network and Operating Systems Support for Digital Audio and Video (NOSSDAV), pp. 74-79, May 2006. <LI> Rongmei Zhang, Chunqiang Tang, Y.

I will consider the number of members of the team when grading project proposals and reports.<P> The project proposal is due <STRONG>Wednesday, February 17th, 2010, by 11:59 PM</STRONG>. If you are working in a group, only one proposal is to be submitted for the entire group. <P> The final project report (in the form of a research paper including references, and possibly a software demonstration) is due on <STRONG>Thursday, May 6th, 2010 by 8:59 AM.</STRONG> <P> Please e-mail your proposal and then your report as PDF attachments to fahmy@cs. (No MS Word documents, please.) <P>The project proposal consists of just two parts: <P><STRONG>I. Problem, Goals, and Methodology</STRONG> (two to three pages)<BR> Format this like a research paper. Make sure to answer <EM>all</EM> the following questions within your text. Do not include the text of the questions within your writeup, but make sure your writeup will contain the answers.<BR> What is the problem you will address, and what are your goals from the study?<BR> Why do you believe your work will be interesting or unique?<BR> What will be the main contributions of your work?<BR> How will you know if you partially/fully succeeded?<P> <EM>What is the research methodology you will follow?</EM> For example, are you designing a new system/algorithm? are you analyzing the performance of a previously developed system? are you simulating one or more algorithms? are you comparing the performance of several techniques/algorithms? are you implementing a previously described system? In all these cases, what are the metrics you plan to measure to evaluate the system/algorithm, and what parameters do you plan to vary in your experiments? What is the hypothesis you are trying to validate with each of your experiments?<P> <P><STRONG>II. Annotated Bibliography</STRONG> (two to three pages)<BR> You can either format this as a "related work" section and bibliography, or include annotations within the bibliography itself:<BR> What are the primary papers/RFCs you are planning to use as a basis of your project? Include a one or two sentence description of what each reference contains, and why it is relevant to your project. <P> See <A HREF="../links.html">"Useful Links"</A> for links to some simulation, implementation and measurements tools, and useful manuals and hints that can help with your project. <P> <STRONG>Please let me know as soon as you can if you will need an account on PlanetLab, Emulab, etc, or if you need any special equipment or software. </STRONG> <P> Also see <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/mleone/web/how-to.html">Collected advice on research and writing</A> for advice on writing and speaking, and some very funny articles, and <A HREF="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~hgs/etc/writing-style.html">Writing Technical Articles</A> for more helpful hints on writing your report. <P> This paper is also helpful: Craig Partridge. <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/sigcomm/ccr/archive/1998/jul98/ccr-9807-partridge.html">How to Increase the Chances Your Paper is Accepted at ACM SIGCOMM</A>, Computer Communication Review, a publication of ACM SIGCOMM, volume 28, number 3, July 1998. <P> <HR><A HREF="index.html">Back to the CS 536 home page</A> <P> <ADDRESS>Last updated by: Sonia Fahmy &lt;<A HREF="mailto:fahmy@cs.purdue.edu">fahmy@cs.purdue.edu</A>&gt;<BR> January 19th, 2010 </ADDRESS><BR> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
