It houses an internetwork of Pentium II desktops, Sun UltraSPARC workstations, and Pentium laptops. Heterogeneous network connectivity is provided through Fast Ethernet, a gigabit Myrinet switch, and WaveLAN wireless interfaces. Gigabytes of distributed disk storage are available. In addition, a variety of multimedia equipment provides live capture and presentation of video and audio data. Currently supporting the Concerto and ISAC projects, SSAL is in a phase of active expansion. <P> <FONT COLOR="#ce9c33" SIZE="-1"> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/ar98" TARGET="_top"> <CENTER> 1998 <BR> Annual Research Report</A> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu" TARGET="_top">Department of <BR> Computer Sciences</A> </CENTER> </FONT> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
