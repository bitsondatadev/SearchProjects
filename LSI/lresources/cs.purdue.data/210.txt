High-performance computing equipment includes a 64 processor nCube 2 and a four processor Silicon Graphics 340VGX graphics workstation. The nCube is used to study parallel methods for solving partial differential equations. The 340VGX is used to display graphical output from simulations and other visualization experiments. In addition to about 30 workstations and compute servers from Sun, Hewlett-Packard, and Silicon Graphics, the SoftLab laboratory includes a complete video production facility. <P> <FONT COLOR="#ce9c33" SIZE="-1"> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/ar98" TARGET="_top"> <CENTER> 1998 <BR> Annual Research Report</A> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu" TARGET="_top">Department of <BR> Computer Sciences</A> </CENTER> </FONT> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
