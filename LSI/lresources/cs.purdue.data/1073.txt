See the general <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse/pses/">PSE web site</a> and the <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse/">Purdue PSE</a> research group web site for more information. Scientific PSEs are intrinsically linked with high performance computing, indeed, one of their primary goals is to hide the complexity of parallel machines. This project has several focus areas <UL> <li> Applications modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs), as in the <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse/pellpack/pellpack.html">Parallel ELLPACK</a> projects. <li> Management of parallel computing resources, see the slides at <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jrr/slides/Salishan1.html"> http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jrr/slides/Salishan1.html</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse/hpc-pses/"> http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse/hpc-pses</a>. <li> Computational intelligence to support scientific PSEs, the <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse/pythia/">PYTHIA</a> project. <li> Network based scientific computing as in the <a href="http://pellpack.cs.purdue.edu/netpp">Net //ELLPACK</a> and <a href="http://www.cecs.missouri.edu/~joshi/sciag/"> SciAgents</a> projects. </UL> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
