The approach is to populate hosts in a distributed system with many small, single-purpose detector agents. These agents monitor various aspects of system behavior, and report unusual behavior to one or more monitoring stations. The monitoring stations integrate the many reports into a comprehensible display. <P> Our design has the advantages of scalability, efficiency, fault-tolerance, and easy configurability. Agents can be customized per host, replicated for fault tolerence, and deployed where especially needed. The impact of these agents is considerably smaller than that of a monolithic monitor. <P> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> </body> </html> </html>
