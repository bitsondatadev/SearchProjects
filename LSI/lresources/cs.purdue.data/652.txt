Brooks Fortune Distinguished Professor of Computer Sciences (1964)</EM><P> <EM> Ph.D., California Institute of Technology, 1959.</EM><P> Professor Rice is founder of the <EM>ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software</EM> and is on several other editorial boards. He is the past chair of the Computing Research Association, a fellow of the AAAS, of the ACM, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. For the past 15 years, Professor Rice has been analyzing numerical methods and problem solving environments for scientific computing. He has created a general methodology for performance evaluation of mathematical software and developed the ELLPACK system for elliptic problems. It is now being extended to Parallel ELLPACK and PDELab. Professor Rice has published 19 books. Among recent ones are <EM>Solving Elliptic Problems with ELLPACK</EM> (Springer-Verlag, 1985), <EM>Mathematical Aspects of Scientific Software</EM> (Springer-Verlag, 1988), and <EM>Expert Systems for Scientific Computing </EM>(North Holland, 1992).<P> <i>Labs:</i> <ul> <li> <A HREF="../facilities/labs/ellpack.html">ELLPACK-PDELab</A> </ul> <i>Projects:</i> <ul> <li> <A HREF="../research/ellpack.html">ELLPACK System</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/hpcpde.html">High-Performance (HPC) and Problem Solving Environments (PSEs)</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/mpse.html">Multidisciplinary Problem Solving Environments</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/netellpack.html">Net PELLPACK</a> <li> <A HREF="../research/pamecosy.html">Parallel Methods and Collaborating Systems for Solving Partial Differential Equations</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/pdesks.html">PDE Solving Kernels and Systems for Multi-Physics Applications</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/pdelab.html">PDELab: A Development and Problem Solving Environment for PDE-Based Applications on Parallel Machines</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/pellpack.html"> PELLPACK: A Problem Solving Environment for PDE Based Applications on Multicomputer Platforms</a> <li> <a href="../research/poems.html"> POEMS--End-toEnd Performance Modeling of Large Heterogeneous Adaptive Parallel/Distributed Computer/Communication Systems</a> <li> <a href="../research/pupsekernel.html"> PPK: Purdue PSE Kernel</a> <li> <A HREF="../research/pythia.html">PYTHIA: Using Computational Intelligence to Support Problem Solving Environments</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/softlab.html">SoftLab</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/wwwellpack.html">Web //ELLPACK: A Web Based Problem Solving Environment for Partial Differential Equations</A> </ul> <P> <i>Honors and Awards:</i> <ul> <li> Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) <li> Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science <li> Member of the National Academy of Engineering <li> George E.
