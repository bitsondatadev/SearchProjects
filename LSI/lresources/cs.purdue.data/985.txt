Unlike for sequential vector processors, algorithm implementation on complex parallel architectures is not logically consistent with traditional programming approaches and the scientific/engineering community is faced with the problem of exploring prospective solution strategies to achieve the high potential performance of parallel machines. Unfortunately this new hardware technology, despite its great potential, has widened the gap between hardware and applications. This project is a successor to <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse/pellpack/pellpack.html"> Parallel ELLPACK</a>. <P> One of the objectives of <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse/pdelab/pdelab.html"> the PDELab</a> project is to study the above problem and design and implement a Problem Solving Environment (PSE) that tries to close this gap, at least for certain applications that are governed by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). <P> This PSE will become available as a <a href="http://pellpack.cs.purdue.edu/netpp"> network server</a> or <a href="http://pellpack.cs.purdue.edu/"> web based server</a> and will be accessible by standard Web communication infrastructure. <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
