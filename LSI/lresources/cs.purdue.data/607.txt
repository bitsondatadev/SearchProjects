The award was made during the undergraduate commencement ceremony at his alma mater, the <a href="http://www.brockport.edu/" target="_blank">SUNY College at Brockport</a>. Professor Spafford was selected for this honor by the State University of New York for his outstanding achievements as a world-renowned researcher and expert in the area of computer and network security, computer crime investigation and information ethics. He was recommended by campus presidents, and faculties and selected by an eminent University-wide Committee on Honorary Degrees at SUNY.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Professor Spafford's honorary doctorate citation saluted his expertise, his government &amp; corporate involvement, his involvement with SUNY Brockport and his continued positive impact.
