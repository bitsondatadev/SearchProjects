Cheng<P> Sponsors: Intel, AT&amp;T<P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <P> Recent advances in wireless communication technologies and high-speed switching systems make it feasible to construct a wireless internet that scales to allow each individual on a university campus to carry a small portable computer with a wireless network adapter. The crosspoint project is researching the problems in constructing such a system. It is not hard to envision an environment in which students carry small, portable computers that can be used, for example, to take notes during a lecture and to later edit and cross reference these notes with other on-line classroom material. Wireless network technology makes it possible to use the same computers to access this information in a library, class room, dorm room, or any place on campus. Such technology can enhance the ability of an instructor to interact with students both inside and outside of class.<P> The solutions being investigated involve combining wireless network technology with high-speed Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switching technology. The combination should provide a wireless communication system with sufficient aggregate bandwidth to handle both data transfers and routing updates for a university sized network. Specific problems being researched include the particularly difficult problems of using wireless communication on a university campus and routing update mechanisms that can handle the routing of wireless traffic across a large campus.<P> We have implemented a prototype system. The system allows students with a wireless portable PC to access the Internet while roaming in the Computer Science Building. The following overview paper provides a detailed description of the prototype: ftp://gwen.cs.purdue.edu/pub/lin/expoint.p5.<P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <ADDRESS>CS Annual Report - 19 APR 1996</ADDRESS> <A HREF="AR95Book-83.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bnext.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-81.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bprev.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-66.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bup.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Btop.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bcontent.gif"></A><BR><A HREF="AR95Book-83.html">[Next] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-81.html">[Previous] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-66.html">[Up] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html">[Top] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html">[Contents]</A> <P> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
