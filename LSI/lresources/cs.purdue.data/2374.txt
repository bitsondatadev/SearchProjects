Such systems require a wide range of expertise plus a flexible and diverse array of equipment. This laboratory provides infrastructure facilities that serve the needs for basic research broadly focused on building problem-solving environments for applied, experimental work for computational science. The facilities include: <A NAME=MARKER-10-64></A><P> <UL> <LI> High-performance graphics processors to support scientific visualization, geometric modeling and design, and multimedia graphical user interfaces for parallel programming and programming in the large.<P> <LI> High-performance computers.<P> <LI> Software and development support staff assisting application researchers in making full use of this facility comprising a rich spectrum of high-performance workstations, powerful parallel machines, and dedicated graphics processors.<P> <LI> A teaching laboratory providing exploratory courses that migrate cutting-edge research into the curriculum with access to state-of-the-art facilities. This laboratory is the principal facility of the interdisciplinary graduate degree program in Computational Science and Engineering.<P> </UL> The laboratory provides an ideal environment to accept and meet the challenges of computational engineering and science. The facility benefits from an environment with strong expertise in mathematical software, electronic prototyping, geometric modeling, parallel algorithms, databases, software engineering, and computer systems. The facility is a catalyst for significant research in computational engineering and science, both within the Computer Science Department, as well as in other departments, and so accelerates the maturation of a number of collaborative, interdisciplinary research projects that are beginning to create a critical mass of applications-oriented research and expertise in computational science. This effort is SoftLab.<P> A central group effort within SoftLab addresses the full range of issues in the future paradigm of computational science. It creates four<EM> problem solving environments: </EM>rigid-body mechanics, idealized internal combustion engine design, and two chemical engineering applications. These involve a core group of computational scientists (Christoph Hoffmann, Elias Houstis, John Rice) and applications scientists. There are a number of basic research efforts in parallel and distributed computing that use SoftLab facilities in an essential way. These include projects in computational biology, simulation, parallel algorithms, cryptology, software engineering, and computational geometry. There are several projects which use the laboratory facilities to build prototype systems for computational science. These include collaboration with researchers in projects in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, biology, and biochemistry. As the facility matures, we plan to expand the number of such collaborations.<P> <H2> A Functional View of SoftLab</H2> The focus of SoftLab is to create a laboratory, with a software layer above the familiar "physical" wet and dry laboratories of science and engineering. The project builds the needed software and algorithmic infrastructure for some of the important activities in a lab and produces the electronic analog of a scientific laboratory environment for important applications. The functional view of the architecture of SoftLab is shown in Figure ? on page ?. It consists of five layers of application-specific and generic software. <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
