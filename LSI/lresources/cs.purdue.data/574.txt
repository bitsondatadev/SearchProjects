Fast algorithms for computing n-body interactions rely on a hierarchical domain discretization coupled with a series representation of subdomains. This project investigates various issues related to hierarchical methods: it addresses issues relating to accuracy, piecewise bases, and computational complexity. Parallel formulations of these accelerated multipole techniques along with their applications in solving dense linear systems are being investigated. <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
