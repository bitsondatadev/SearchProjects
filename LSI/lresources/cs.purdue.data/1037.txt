He was Director of the Computer and Computation Research Division at the National Science Foundation from 1989-91. Prior to joining the faculty at Purdue, he was a professor of information and computer science and director of Software Engineering Research at Georgia Tech.<P> Although he has worked in theoretical computer science and computer security, Professor DeMillo's primary interests are in software testing and reliability. He is co-developer of the program mutation approach to software testing, and his current research centers on building large-scale tools and methodologies that will enable software engineering to design and implement large software systems for life-critical applications such as air traffic control.<P> Projects: <A HREF=AR95Book-78.html>Software Engineering Research Center (SERC)</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <ADDRESS>CS Annual Report - 19 APR 1996</ADDRESS> <A HREF="AR95Book-17.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bnext.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-15.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bprev.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-6.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bup.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Btop.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bcontent.gif"></A><BR><A HREF="AR95Book-17.html">[Next] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-15.html">[Previous] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-6.html">[Up] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html">[Top] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html">[Contents]</A> <P> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
