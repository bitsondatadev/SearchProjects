<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE>Mathur</TITLE> </HEAD> <BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"> <P> Dr. Mathur is the Director of the NSF sponsored multi-university Software Engineering Research Center <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/serc" TARGET="_top">(SERC)</a>. He is also the Associate Head of the Department of Computer Sciences. During 1982-85 he was the Head of the Computer Science Department at Birla Institute of Technology and Science located at Pilani, India. Prior to joining Purdue Dr. Mathur was a Visiting Associate Professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the School of Information and Computer Science during 1985-87. <P> Dr. Mathur's current research interests lie in the broad area of Software Engineering. In the area of software testing and reliability, he is collaborating with Professor Nozer Singpurwalla, George Washington University, Professor Jose Maldonado, University of Sao Paulo at Sao Carlos, Bob Horgan, Bellcore, and Dr. Alberto Pasquini, ENEA, Italy, to develop a new theory of software reliability that accounts for the amount of testing done and the architecture of the software. Towards this end, Dr. Mathur conducts experiments to investigate (i) the goodness of Interface Mutation for assessing the adequacy of integration tests, (ii) relationship between testing and reliability, and (iii) architecture based estimation of software reliability. In the area of fault-tolerance he is investigating the goodness of an interface-based fault injection method for assessing the fault-tolerance of systems built from standard off-the shelf software components. In the area of education for the disabled, he has developed a technique and a tool for adding sound to computer programs. The same tool and technique are also being used to investigate the possibility of generating novel musical compositions mapped from program behaviors. </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
