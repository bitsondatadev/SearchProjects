He is the past chair of the Computing Research Association, a fellow of the AAAS, of the ACM, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. For the past 15 years, Professor Rice has been analyzing numerical methods and problem solving environments for scientific computing. He has created a general methodology for performance evaluation of mathematical software and developed the ELLPACK system for elliptic problems. It is now being extended to Parallel ELLPACK and PDELab. Professor Rice has published 19 books. Among recent ones are <I>Solving Elliptic Problems with ELLPACK</I> (Springer-Verlag, 1985), <I>Mathematical Aspects of Scientific Software</I> (Springer-Verlag, 1988), and <I>Expert Systems for Scientific Computing</I> (North Holland, 1992). </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
