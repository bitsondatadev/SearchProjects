<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE>Bhargava</TITLE> </HEAD> <BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"> Professor Bhargava's research involves both theoretical and experimental studies in distributed systems. His research group has implemented a robust and adaptable distributed database system called RAID to conduct experiments in replication control, checkpointing, and communications. He has conducted experiments in large scale distributed systems, communications, and overheads in implementing object support on top of the relational model. Professor Bhargava has recently developed an adaptable video conferencing system using the NV system from Xerox PARC. He is conducting experiments with research issues in large scale communication networks to support emerging applications such as digital library and multi-media databases. <P> Professor Bhargava was the chairman of the <i>IEEE Symposium on Reliable and Distributed Systems</i> held at Purdue in October 1998. Professor Bhargava is on the editorial board of three international journals. In the 1988 <i>IEEE Data Engineering Conference</i>, he and John Riedl received the best paper award for their work on "A Model for Adaptable Systems for Transaction Processing." Professor Bhargava is a fellow of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and Institute of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers. He has been awarded the Gold Core Member distinction by IEEE Computer Society for his distinguished service. He received Outstanding Instructor Awards, from the Purdue chapter of the ACM. </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
