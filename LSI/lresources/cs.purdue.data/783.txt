FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) is a multinational organization that aspires to change the way students see engineering, science, and technology. Purdue Computer Science sponsors FIRST scholarships for students who become CS majors in the department. </p> <p class="style1">The FIRST Robotics Competition challenges teams to solve a common problem in a six-week timeframe using a standard "kit of parts" and a common set of rules. Teams made up of high school students, teachers, engineers, and other mentors build robots from the parts and compete with other teams around the world. </p> <p class="style1">FIRST was founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen, inventor of the Segway Human Transporter, and in 1992 the inaugural FIRST competition was held with 28 teams. 15 years later, it has grown to over 1000 teams.</p> <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p> <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p> <p class="style1">For more information on this, visit the <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/">FIRST website</a>.</p> <p class="style1">Visit the Department of Computer Science <a href="http://www.usfirst.org/uploadedfiles/About_Us/Scholarships/2011_Assets/2011_FIRST_Purdue_U_Computer_Science_Scholarship_Desc.pdf">FIRST Scholarship Application</a> for more information.</p> <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table> </div> </body> </html> </html>
