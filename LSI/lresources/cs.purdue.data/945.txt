Developed with the <a href="http://rebar.ecn.purdue.edu:8080/3id/about.php">3iD</a> research team, the application was downloaded 180 times within four days of its debut.</p> <p class="style1">Chris Nuland and 3iD are currently working on three other applications for Android and iPad, with content interests ranging from education to construction management. They hope to launch all three in early 2012.</p> <p class="style1">The article &quot;Purdue students, faculty and staff can use new service to commercialize, market mobile device applications&quot; by the <a href="http://prf.org/">Purdue Research Foundation</a> is reprinted below.</p> <img src="images/otc-mobile.jpg" width="292" height="624" align="left" /> <p class="style1">WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. - The path from smartphone and mobile device application development to commercialization may have become smoother for Purdue University students, faculty and staff.</p> <p class="style1">Officials in Purdue Research Foundation's Office of Technology Commercialization (OTC) have established a service to quickly test, commercialize and market mobile applications developed with university resources.</p> <p class="style1"> The first mobile application delivered through the OTC portal was placed in the Apple Store on Oct. 17. Phototate is a free application developed by 3iD that allows users to upload digital photos to a web application, create presentations and catalog photos based on date and description. Because Phototate has a fully integrated GPS map system, users can view the exact location where photos were taken.<br /> <br /> &quot;Phototate was downloaded more than 180 times during the first four days it was available at the App Store,&quot; said Christopher Nuland, the 3iD Phototate developer. &quot;Everyone at 3iD was proud that the application was approved the first time it was reviewed. It reconfirms that we can help other applications developed by Purdue students, faculty and staff reach storefronts in a timely manner.&quot;<br /> <br /> Joseph B. Hornett, senior vice president, treasurer and COO of the Purdue Research Foundation, said the comprehensive service from OTC involves an all-Purdue process.<br /> <br /> &quot;When the developer shares information with the Office of Technology Commercialization, the application is sent for testing to 3iD, a research team associated with the College of Engineering,&quot; he said. &quot;3iD makes sure the application complies with the standards and regulations required by mobile device application stores including the Apple Store, Google Market, App World and others.&quot;<br /> <br /> Purdue research scientist Bob McCullouch described the work done by 3iD once it receives the application. He said it begins with working on the distribution certificate and packaging the application for each of the stores where it will be submitted.<br /> <br /> &quot;My colleagues and I upload the application to the stores and assist in the review phase,&quot; he said. &quot;Once the application has been approved, we maintain the storefront, give marketing privileges to the correct users and assist in submitting updates.&quot;<br /> <br /> Hornett said Purdue students, faculty and staff have long been at the forefront in developing new technologies that help the public.<br /> <br /> &quot;Mobile apps are used abundantly in recreational, academic and business settings,&quot; he said. &quot;The service offered by the Office of Technology Commercialization and 3iD was developed to optimize the process of moving discoveries to the public for everyone's benefit.&quot;<br /> <br /> For more information about developing mobile and smartphone applications through the new service from OTC and 3iD, contact Michael Halbrook, 765-588-3483, <a href="mailto:mlhalbrook@prf.org">mlhalbrook@prf.org</a></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table> </div> </body> </html>
