The system was designed for concurrent execution on uni-processor, shared memory multi-processors, and distributed memory platforms supporting Unix.</P> <P>It is currently available on several environments, including Sun Sparcs (SunOS4 and Solaris), Sequent Symmetry, IBM RS6000, SGI, and Intel i860 processors. It is highly portable, utilizing only a few lines of assembly code.</P> <P>Ariadne provides a customization layer through which it lends itself to finely tuned customizations: support for scheduling via a built-in scheduler or an application specific scheduler, and a communication-library interface.</P> <P>Unique features of Ariadne include support for arbitrary distributed computing libraries/environments (e.g., PVM, P4) and support for inter-process thread migration. Application-level threads may migrate from one process to another to access and compute with remote data.</P> <P>Ariadne also provides precise and efficient timing and signal handling primitives making it ideal for the development of multithreaded servers, communication protocols, and other applications that may benefit from timely and asynchrounous actions.</P> <DT><H2><IMG ALT="o " SRC="pics/bluedot.gif">Principal Investigators</H2> <DD><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/connell">Edward Connell</A>, PhD Student <DD><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/pollard">James Pollard</A>, PhD Student <DD><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/bruggest">Terry Brugger</A>, BS Computer Sciences <DD><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/gomez">Juan C.
