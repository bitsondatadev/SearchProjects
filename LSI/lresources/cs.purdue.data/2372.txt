Any infractions of this code will be dealt with STRICTLY in accordance with the established rules of Purdue University. </p> <ul> <li> ALL work in this class is individual, unless prior permission has been explicitly granted by the instructor. Any evidence of copying or cooperation will be considered academic dishonesty. <br> <br> <li> It is the students' responsibility to adequately protect their work on the computer. If you need assistance protecting your work, please contact your TA or instructor. It is a good idea to read-protect all your work and not share your password with anyone. <br> <br> <li> In cases of academic dishonesty, all parties will be considered equally responsible, even if one admits to copying from the other. <br> <br> <li> All programs will be checked for copying using a tool called MOSS. I would encourage you to read more about MOSS at <a href = "http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~aiken/moss.html"> http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~aiken/moss.html</a>. Feel free to submit programs to this tool and see if you can fool it into not recognizing copied programs. (I would not take chances copying programs with this tool.) This is in addition to visual inspection of the programs by the TAs/instructors. <br> <br> <li> Please realize that in case you copy a homework, the penalty must be more than a zero grade for that particular homework. (If this were not the case, one would have nothing to lose by simply copying a homework that he/she had not done in the first place). <br> <br> </ul> </td> </font> </table> </BODY></HTML> </BODY></HTML>
