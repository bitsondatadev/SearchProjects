Software defects could be fatal, causing human injury or death. The persistence of software defects inspires wave after wave of attacks. Every year major corporations and government invest tremendous amount of money to fix software bugs, but the prospect of building reliable software remains grim. Therefore, analyzing and fixing software defects is one of the most active research areas today. In this course students will have the opportunity of getting acquainted with the state of the art of software defect analysis and designing their own analysis. The experience in this course can easily benefit research in many other fields that require analyzing programs. More specifically, this course covers (draft): <UL> <LI> Program slicing, including static and dynamic slicing. <LI> Concurrent program debugging, focusing on data race detection and atomicity violation detection. <LI> Model checking. <LI> Test generation with the focus on concolic testing. <LI> Satisfiability based program analysis. <LI> Input analysis, including delta debugging and execution reduction. <LI> Failure indexing, namely clustering program failures reports based on the errors. <LI> Open to suggestions. </UL> <h3><em>Relevant Conferences and Journals in</em><br> Software Engineering, Programming Languages and Compilers<br> & Operating Systems.</h3> <UL> <li><b>FSE, ESEC-FSE</b> - ACM SIGSOFT Symposium on Foundations of Software Engineering <li><b>PLDI</b> - ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation. <li><b>ASPLOS</b> - International conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and operating Systems. <li><b>ICSE</b> - SIGSOFT/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering. <li><b>ASE</b> - IEEE International Conference on Automated Software Engineering. <li><b>ISSTA</b> - ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis. <li><b>ICSM</b> - IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance.
