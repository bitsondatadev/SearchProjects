It is being designed to support a suite of protocols for the support of multimodal traffic, including unreliable, reliable, and real-time transmissions. Besides integrated services and multicast, Clam is being designed for high-performance distributed computation and interaction. By implementing protocol actions in user-space and attending to client needs and network traffic in a responsive manner, the protocol attempts to minimize packet loss at receive buffers and simultaneously maximize CPU attention to application-related compute work. Clam is being implemented as a communications infrastructure for a multithreaded CMPI (Clam-based MPI) system. <P> For more information please see <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/PaCS/PaCS.html"> http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/PaCS/PaCS.html</a> <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
