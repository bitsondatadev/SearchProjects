His end system support architecture has been prototyped as an extension to the Solaris operating system. The architecture provides rate-based reservation and scheduling for time-shared resources, such as CPU and network interface. In addition, the adaptive rate-controlled (ARC) CPU scheduling framework allows multimedia applications to dynamically monitor their execution rates, and renegotiate CPU reservations based on the current rate. <em> Migrating Sockets</em>, a user-level protocol implementation framework in the end system architecture, works well with ARC by minimizing <em>hidden scheduling</em>, which is commonly found in current protocol processing systems. <P> Dr. Yau's current interests are in design, implementation and deployment issues for next generation internetwork routers. He is investigating the feasibility of achieving Gbps (or higher) packet routing performance on general purpose computers, and the role of "router operating systems" in providing performance guarantees to diverse flows. <P> <i>Projects:</i> <UL> <li> System support for networking with QoS guarantees <li> Wide-area active caching for internetwork information providers <li> Design, implementation and deployment issues for next generation internetwork routers </UL> <P> <A HREF="../publications/yau.html">Recent Publications</a> <P> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/yau"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
