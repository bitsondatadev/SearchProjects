The eight-person team included three students from Computer Science: <strong>Yilong Jin</strong> (Junior), financial officer, <strong>Scott Toland</strong> (Junior), webmaster, and <strong>Gabriel Martinez Vidiri</strong>, (Senior), webmaster, with assistance from <strong>William J. Culhane</strong> (graduate student), EPICS teaching assistant. <br /> <br />The AMD Award is a team award for excellence in design. It is funded by money donated by AMD specifically for this purpose. This is usually awarded to an entire team, but may be awarded to a specific project team if appropriate. The recipients of this award will receive a monetary award and a sculptured desk award with an EPICS nameplate. <br /><br />During the final design review, the external reviewers, coming from well known software services enterprises, were impressed by the work they saw by the team. The team demonstrated its knowledge and mastering of the design process and its application to software design. They also did an excellent job in answering probing questions that tested their design knowledge. <br /><br />Congratulations to the Computer Science students and the entire EPICS DISC team for their hard work and receiving recognition for their excellence in design. </p></td> </tr> </table> </body> </html> </html>
