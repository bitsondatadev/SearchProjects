It concerns the direct simulation of particle flows in Newtonian and viscoelastic fluids. The research team consists of researchers at Minnesota, Houston, Pennsylvania, Purdue, and Stanford. The team at Purdue has constructed a comprehensive simulation environment for the flow of particles in viscoelastic fluids, bringing together the expertise of those members of the teams in fluid mechanics, computer science, and mathematics. It incorporates diverse physical models of the fluid with many innovative numerical methods for the solution of the associated partial differential equations. A new multilevel preconditioner for the Navier-Stokes equation was developed at Purdue, and has shown excellent parallel performance for physical flow problems. The code itself, also developed at Purdue, uses the MPI and Petsc framework to ensure portable, extensible, and efficient parallel code. Current work at Purdue has also concentrated on developing effective parallel nonlinear and linear system solvers and the relationship of the tolerances involved in these inner-outer iterations. <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
