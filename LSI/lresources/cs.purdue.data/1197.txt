Intel was a founding member of the Computer Science Corporate Partners Program which began in 1995. Since that time Intel has been a dedicated supporter of the Purdue Computer Science Department. Intel is a valuable advisor and a wealth of information to the department. They continually show interest in the CS program with the attention they give CS students, frequent campus visits, and strong contributions to CS facilities.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since June 2005 Intel has given the department $175,000 in equipment including 70 workstations, a server, and software for CS labs. Students who use the Programming and Software Engineering Instructional Laboratory work on Intel workstations. Future plans show an Intel server and workstations being set up in the Programming I and Programming with Multimedia Objects Laboratory after the first of the year. The CS Systems and Security Instructional Laboratory, dedicated on September 8, 2005, features Intel workstations and software.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The CS Systems and Security Instructional Laboratory was dedicated during one of Intel's visits to CS. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. George Cox, Director of Distributed Services Architecture Computing Platforms Group, cut the ceremonial ribbon at the CS Systems and Security Instructional Laboratory dedication while visiting Purdue on September 8, 2005. Dr. Cox received his PhD in computer science from Purdue in 1975 and returned to his alma mater this year as the Intel Distinguished Lecturer. He gave a talk on <em><a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/news/9-8-05coxINTEL.shtml">Trustworthy Platforms: Problems, Promises, Concepts, Practical Realities, and Research Opportunities</a></em>. </font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The goal of the CS Corporate Partners Program (CPP) is to foster close communication and promote mutually beneficial relationships. In support of their relationship with Purdue CS, Intel visits campus often. Purdue alumnae and Intel executive, Dr. Steve Tolopka, is the Intel representative on the CS Corporate Partner Panel. Dr. Tolopka, Director of Platform Architecture Research for Intel's Corporate Technology Group, received his PhD in computer science from Purdue in 1981. He attended the CPP meeting on September 19 and 20, 2005 at the Purdue West Lafayette campus. During his visit he toured the new Lawson Computer Science Building and saw the view from the Tolopka Terrace for the first time. The building terrace is named for Dr. Tolopka in honor of his support for the department and generous donation to the Lawson Building Campaign.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Kevin Kahn toured the new Lawson Building during his campus visit on September 30, 2005 for the Purdue Key Executives meeting. Dr. Kahn, Intel Sr. Fellow/Director Communications Architecture, is the namesake for the Department Head Suite in recognition of his generosity to the Lawson Building Campaign and advocacy of the Purdue CS Department. Dr. Kahn received his MS in 1973 and his PhD in 1976 both from the Purdue Department of Computer Science.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">JoZell Johnson, Intel Academic Relations Engineer, came to Purdue on October 14, 2005 to visit CS. JoZell is the liaison between Intel and the department. She works closely with the CS Department in nurturing the relationship between Intel and CS.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The second 2005 Intel Distinguished Lecturer, Dr. Ralph Kling, will visit campus on November 10, 2005. Dr. Kling is the Principal Researcher of the &quot;Intel Mote&quot; Corporate Technology Group. His talk is entitled<em> Intel Motes and Sensor Networks </em>and will take place at 3:30 pm on November 10 in STEW206. </font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In addition to providing technical talks and presenting to undergraduate classes, Intel shows its interest for Purdue CS students in many other ways. Intel participated at the 2005 CS Career Fair, and recruits many Purdue CS graduates. Many of the Intel campus representatives are Purdue graduates themselves. The Intel fellowship program also supports the work of CS graduate students. The recipient of the <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/news/06-14-05_intelfellowship.shtml">Intel Foundation fellowship for the 2005-06 academic year</a> was Ethan Blanton. Intel representatives also enjoy kicking back with Purdue CS students a few times a year at the Corporate Partners Student Mixer. Intel's dedication to Purdue CS is unsurpassed, and CS's appreciation is steadfast. </font></p> </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td><p align="center"><img src="images/intel-KKahn.jpg" width="202" height="198"></p> </td> <td><div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/intel-JoZell.jpg" width="268" height="193" align="middle"></font></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="357"><div align="center"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Kevin Kahn received a personalized Purdue hard hat for touring the Kahn Department Head Suite. </font></div></td> <td width="381"><div align="center"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Tim Korb and Dr. Susanne Hambrusch welcome<br> JoZell Johnson (center) on her most recent campus visit.</font></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"><div align="center"></div> <div align="center"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"><p>&nbsp;</p> </td> </tr> </table> </body> </html> </html>
