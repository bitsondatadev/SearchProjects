class="level1"> <p> Where most faculty, students, and research labs are located. The adminstrative staff for the CS department is located here. The basement houses the TA offices and computer labs for students. Including the basement, there are 5 floors (though most people will never enter the top floor). The 3rd floor has a balcony that overlooks University St. and 3rd St. </p> </div> <h1><a name="felix_haas_hall" id="felix_haas_hall">Felix Haas Hall</a></h1> <div class="level1"> <p> The main computer science building until Lawson was completed in Fall 2006. Even though other departments have taken over much of the space, a few labs and faculty still remain in this building. </p> </div> <h1><a name="mathematical_sciences_building" id="mathematical_sciences_building">Mathematical Sciences Building</a></h1> <div class="level1"> <p> With the addition of the Computer Science building, very little of our department remains in good ol&#039; “Math-Sci.” A brief tour of the building, starting from the basement (remember, there are two basements, but the elevators are only on the south side) and moving skyward, follows: <br/> </p> <ul> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> Basement: There are graduate student offices and, more importantly, there is an ITaP lab which is open 24 hours. The lab has Windows boxes, Mac computers, and Sun workstations. Additionally, the basement floor has machines which dispense milk, pop, coffee, candy (beware, the chocolate bars are often gooey) and various munchies. </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> Ground: More student offices. </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> Main Floor: There&#039;s a mailbox in the south (elevator) side of the building. MATH 175 on the other side is often used for colloquia. Basically, the main floor is a large wind-tunnel, called the “breezeway.”</div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> 2nd Floor: This has mostly offices that deal with undergrads (in particular, counseling). </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> 3rd Floor: Math Library. It is accessible only from the elevator (south) side of the building. This can be a good place to hide, as there are numerous study carrels and desks. It is sometimes a good place to go for meetings on projects. Additionally, the library has a couple of copy machines (5 cents per sheet). </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> 4th Floor: The fourth floor hosts the Indiana Center for Database Systems (ICDS) with faculty and student offices. </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> 5th Floor: Presently inhabited by statisticians and mathematicians. </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> 8th Floor: Main math offices. Sometimes you also need to go there to obtain a key to your office. </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> 9th Floor: Offices of the Dean of the School of Science, his staff, and Women in Science Program (WISP) staff. </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> 10th Floor: Reachable only through the stairs, this is a mysterious place to which few venture. </div> </li> </ul> </div> <h1><a name="recitation_building" id="recitation_building">Recitation Building</a></h1> <div class="level1"> <p> Until a few years ago, the Recitation (REC) building, directly east of MATH, was only of interest if you had a class there. Starting from the Fall of 1999, however, the second floor of REC is home to the Center for Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security (CERIAS, pronounced like “serious”). CERIAS grew out of the COAST laboratory in Computer Science, but with its current Center status is able to have a much larger multidisciplinary reach, although it still has very strong connections with CS. Several CS faculty and staff members as well as grad students have offices there. So if you are interested in matters related to security, healthy paranoia and being a white hat, make sure you visit there. </p> </div> <h1><a name="adminstrative_offices" id="adminstrative_offices">Adminstrative Offices</a></h1> <div class="level1"> <p> Schleman and Hovde Halls are the main student services and administration buildings. There are a number of major administrative attractions in these two buildings including: </p> <ul> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>The Registrar&#039;s Office</strong> - Hovde </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>The Bursar&#039;s Office</strong> - Hovde </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>The Dean of Students Office</strong> - Schleman </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>The Admissions Office</strong> - Schleman </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Registration Headquarters</strong> - Schleman </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>International Student Services</strong> - Schleman </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Business Office of Student Organizations</strong> - Schleman </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <strong>Office of Space Management and Academic Scheduling</strong> - 4th floor of the Engineering Administration Building (ENAD 402)</div> </li> </ul> </div> <h1><a name="purdue_memorial_union" id="purdue_memorial_union">Purdue Memorial Union</a></h1> <div class="level1"> <p> The Memorial Union (in memory of Purdue alums killed in wars) was built back when it was stylish and economically feasible to incorporate a good deal of wood in finishing the interior of a building. The varnished woodwork, solid wood tables and chairs, and stone and wood floors are a refreshing change from the plastic, concrete, veneer and linoleum which surrounds you in most places. Also featured are lots of old moldy plaques commemorating people who would otherwise be forgotten, and a 3-D model of the campus (a <em>must</em> for visiting parents). </p> <p> Functionally, the predominant features of the Union are eating places, meeting places (various ballrooms and lounges), and sleeping places (the “Union Club” hotel rooms for convention attendees, visiting parents, etc.). For details about the eating places, see the section about on-campus dining. Other useful facilities in the PMU include: </p> <ul> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>The Student ID Card Office</em> - west end of the main floor, room 130. They also handle BoilerExpress in that office. </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>Check Cashing Service</em> - east end of the main floor; $50.00 limit and $.100 charge per check. </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>BoilerCopyMaker</em> - a pretty well-equipped copy center is in Room 157 of the Union. Purdue has an agreement with Microsoft that allows Purdue students, faculty and staff to buy Microsoft software for $5. See <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/MSCA/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.purdue.edu/MSCA/" rel="nofollow">http://www.purdue.edu/MSCA/</a> for more information. </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>PEFCU Branch</em> - a branch of Purdue Employees Federal Credit Union is located in the west wing of the main floor. </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>STA Travel Office</em> - west wing of the building, on the ground floor, where you may find discount student tickets for domestic and international travel. </div> </li> </ul> <p> The Purdue Memorial Union also possesses facilities for a number of entertainment and recreation activities: </p> <ul> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>television lounges</em> on the ground and first floors </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>an art gallery</em> on the first floor </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>bowling lanes</em> in the basement </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>pool tables</em> underground between PMU and Stewart Center </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>video arcade</em> on the ground floor</div> </li> </ul> </div> <h1><a name="stewart_center" id="stewart_center">Stewart Center</a></h1> <div class="level1"> <p> From here it is possible to walk through tunnels and buildings all the way to either Grad House without going outside, as well as to either of the three parking garages, Marsteller Street (across from Hawkins Grad House), Wood Street (across from Young Grad House), or Grant Street (across from the Union). The main attractions of the Stewart Center are: </p> <ul> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>Fowler Hall</em>, on the first floor, an auditorium equipped for movie screenings </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>Loeb Playhouse</em>, the Purdue Experimental Theatre </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>An Art Gallery</em>, off the west foyer on the first floor </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>HSSE library</em>, on the first floor, see the section on libraries for details </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>An ITaP Lab</em>, first floor, often very crowded </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>ITaP Customer Service Center</em>, on the ground floor, room G68, phone 49-44000; a first and single point of contact for support with many ITaP services </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>Audio-Visual Center</em>, ground floor </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>Candy Stand</em>, main floor, sells candy to rot your teeth, paperbacks to rot your mind, and practically every magazine you&#039;ve ever heard of plus hundreds more that you&#039;ve never heard of </div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>Envision Center</em>, on the ground floor level between Steward Center and PMU, the center for data perceptualization, see also <a href="http://www.envision.purdue.edu" class="urlextern" title="http://www.envision.purdue.edu" rel="nofollow">http://www.envision.purdue.edu</a> </div> </li> </ul> <p> The <strong>Center for Career Opportunities</strong> is located on the main floor on the east side of the north end of the east hall of the Stewart Center (and you thought directions had to be clear!). They provide helpful advice free of charge to everyone regardless of their career interests or visa status. You can register with CCO on CCO Express at <a href="https://www.cco.purdue.edu/student/CCOExpress.shtml" class="urlextern" title="https://www.cco.purdue.edu/student/CCOExpress.shtml" rel="nofollow">https://www.cco.purdue.edu/student/CCOExpress.shtml</a>. Details relating to corporate interviewing on campus and job vacancy postings are found there along with some pretty good job search help videos. More than 600 companies show up at the CCO every year to hire both internship candidates and graduating students. They also conduct quite a few workshops including ones that target graduate students. </p> </div> <h1><a name="purdue_libraries" id="purdue_libraries">Purdue Libraries</a></h1> <div class="level1"> <p> The Purdue Library System is dispersed throughout many buildings on campus which can make locating a particular book very difficult. Fortunately, their web-based catalog can direct you to the right location if you remember to check it before you leave home. There are over a dozen different libraries spread around campus including: </p> <ul> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>HSSE Library</em> in Stewart Center</div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>Undergraduate Library</em> adjacent to Stewart Center</div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>Mathematical Sciences Library</em> in the Math Building</div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>Potter Engineering Library</em> in Potter Center</div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>Chemistry Library</em> in Brown Laboratory</div> </li> <li class="level1"><div class="li"> <em>Krannert Management Library</em> in the Krannert Building</div> </li> </ul> <p> Notable items in the <strong>Humanities, Social Sciences, and Education (HSSE) Library</strong> include the complete, out-of-date card catalog for all the university&#039;s libraries, the Interlibrary Loan Service, several photocopiers, and a complete collection of all Masters and Ph.D. theses written at Purdue. The latter are kept in a steel vault 700 feet underground, guarded by rabid reference librarians. At the reference desk you may obtain in-library use of one (a dissertation, not a reference librarian) by posting your life as security for its return. </p> <p> There is also a lab, called Digital Learning Collaboratory, at the lower level of the library from which you can check out nice digital equipment, including digital cameras and video cameras and laptops, with a student ID. Information about the lab is also available online at <a href="http://dlc.purdue.edu" class="urlextern" title="http://dlc.purdue.edu" rel="nofollow">http://dlc.purdue.edu</a>. </p> <p> The <strong>Undergraduate Library</strong>, just south of Stewart Center, is oriented toward freshman and sophomore students but there are useful items for all students. You may want to check out the comfortable vending lounge. Notable items in ``Undergrad&#039;&#039; are Purdue&#039;s film library, a 24 hour lounge/study room, and the Independent Study Center. One can also find popular reading materials (i.e. paperbacks, magazines, American and foreign newspapers) and a lot more photocopy machines in this building. Also, in recent years, the undergraduate library has been open 24 hours during dead and finals week, so it is a good place to hide/study/sleep during that period. </p> <p> The <strong>Mathematical Sciences Library</strong> occupies the third floor of the Math Science building and serves the Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Sciences departments. One large room is a reading room for Math graduate students and faculty and has a fair amount of blackboard space, as well as coffee and cookies every day from 3-4 pm (though rumor has it, this is for math majors only). There are several smaller study rooms in the back with smaller amounts of blackboard space. There are two photocopy machines near the main desk. As for holdings, the collection of CS journals is quite good and includes Computing Reviews, many conference proceedings are available but may be hard to find, and copies of most Math, Stat, and CS dissertations from Purdue are kept in the grad/faculty room. Many CS books must be requested at the desk because they have been prone to mysterious disappearance. The organization of this library is usually not obvious to the uninitiated, but the staff are quite friendly, so don&#039;t hesitate to ask at the desk for help in locating materials. </p> <p> The <strong>Engineering Library</strong> is housed in the Potter Engineering Center, which is just east of the building with the big smokestack. It features numerous copies of all the IEEE Transactions, <acronym title="Massachusetts Institute of Technology">MIT</acronym> PhD dissertations, and a sensor which beeps at you if you try to exit with an unchecked-out book. </p> <p> The <strong>Krannert Library</strong> takes up the second and third floors of the Krannert Building. In the Corporate Records Room you can read all about how your favorite corporation is doing. It is also a great place to learn more about companies before interviews. </p> <p> <strong>Purdue University Libraries online</strong> provides access to the Purdue Libraries&#039; on-line catalog, media catalog, bibliographic databases, and access to Indiana and Big 10 catalogs. You can access it at <a href="http://www.lib.purdue.edu" class="urlextern" title="http://www.lib.purdue.edu" rel="nofollow">http://www.lib.purdue.edu</a>. </p> <p> In addition, Purdue has university-wide online subscription to the ACM and IEEE digital libraries (<a href="http://www.acm.org/dl" class="urlextern" title="http://www.acm.org/dl" rel="nofollow">http://www.acm.org/dl</a> and <a href="http://ieeexpert.ieee.org" class="urlextern" title="http://ieeexpert.ieee.org" rel="nofollow">http://ieeexpert.ieee.org</a>, respectively), and also recently subscribed to the LNCS digital archive (<a href="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/" class="urlextern" title="http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/" rel="nofollow">www.springer.de/comp/lncs/</a>).

Here is what Purdue currently has available: Both Hawkins and Young have music rooms, but you must live there to check out the key (or know someone who lives there). Hawkins has a moderately large room with a servicable baby grand, while Young has a smaller room with a small upright piano and an organ inside. Both rooms can be checked out for two hours. </p> <p> The South Tower in the PMU (accessible from the top floor, in the middle of the building just where the campus map is) also has a piano, but only student organizations are permitted to book that room. In addition, that piano is not in the greatest condition. </p> </div> <!-- wikipage stop --> </div> <div class="clearer">&nbsp;</div> <div class="stylefoot"> <div class="meta"> <div class="user"> </div> <div class="doc"> survival_guide/university_buildings.txt &middot; Last modified: 2007/07/30 00:42 by nandrysc </div> </div> <div class="bar" id="bar__bottom"> <div class="bar-left" id="bar__bottomleft"> <form class="button" method="post" action="/gsb/survival_guide:university_buildings"><div class="no"><input type="hidden" name="do" value="edit" /><input type="hidden" name="rev" value="" /><input type="submit" value="Show pagesource" class="button" accesskey="v" title="Show pagesource [ALT+V]" /></div></form> <form class="button" method="get" action="/gsb/survival_guide:university_buildings"><div class="no"><input type="hidden" name="do" value="revisions" /><input type="submit" value="Old revisions" class="button" accesskey="o" title="Old revisions [ALT+O]" /></div></form> </div> <div class="bar-right" id="bar__bottomright"> <form class="button" method="get" action="/gsb/survival_guide:university_buildings"><div class="no"><input type="hidden" name="do" value="login" /><input type="submit" value="Login" class="button" title="Login" /></div></form> <form class="button" method="get" action="/gsb/survival_guide:university_buildings"><div class="no"><input type="hidden" name="do" value="index" /><input type="submit" value="Index" class="button" accesskey="x" title="Index [ALT+X]" /></div></form> <a class="nolink" href="#dokuwiki__top"><input type="button" class="button" value="Back to top" onclick="window.scrollTo(0, 0)" title="Back to top" /></a>&nbsp; </div> <div class="clearer"></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="footerinc"> <a href="/gsb/feed.php" title="Recent changes RSS feed"><img src="/gsb/lib/tpl/sidebar/images/button-rss.png" width="80" height="15" alt="Recent changes RSS feed" /></a> <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/" rel="license" title="Creative Commons License"><img src="/gsb/lib/tpl/sidebar/images/button-cc.gif" width="80" height="15" alt="Creative Commons License" /></a> <a href="https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business=andi%40splitbrain.org&amp;item_name=DokuWiki+Donation&amp;no_shipping=1&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=EUR&amp;lc=US" title="Donate"><img src="/gsb/lib/tpl/sidebar/images/button-donate.gif" alt="Donate" width="80" height="15" /></a> <a href="http://www.php.net" title="Powered by PHP"><img src="/gsb/lib/tpl/sidebar/images/button-php.gif" width="80" height="15" alt="Powered by PHP" /></a> <a href="http://validator.w3.org/check/referer" title="Valid XHTML 1.0"><img src="/gsb/lib/tpl/sidebar/images/button-xhtml.png" width="80" height="15" alt="Valid XHTML 1.0" /></a> <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/check/referer?profile=css3" title="Valid CSS"><img src="/gsb/lib/tpl/sidebar/images/button-css.png" width="80" height="15" alt="Valid CSS" /></a> <a href="http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki" title="Driven by DokuWiki"><img src="/gsb/lib/tpl/sidebar/images/button-dw.png" width="80" height="15" alt="Driven by DokuWiki" /></a> <!-- <rdf:RDF xmlns="http://web.resource.org/cc/" xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" xmlns:rdf="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#"> <Work rdf:about=""> <dc:type rdf:resource="http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text" /> <license rdf:resource="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/" /> </Work> <License rdf:about="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/"> <permits rdf:resource="http://web.resource.org/cc/Reproduction" /> <permits rdf:resource="http://web.resource.org/cc/Distribution" /> <requires rdf:resource="http://web.resource.org/cc/Notice" /> <requires rdf:resource="http://web.resource.org/cc/Attribution" /> <prohibits rdf:resource="http://web.resource.org/cc/CommercialUse" /> <permits rdf:resource="http://web.resource.org/cc/DerivativeWorks" /> <requires rdf:resource="http://web.resource.org/cc/ShareAlike" /> </License> </rdf:RDF> --> </div> <div class="no"><img src="/gsb/lib/exe/indexer.php?id=survival_guide%3Auniversity_buildings&amp;1327902624" width="1" height="1" alt="" /></div> </body> </html> </html>
