Such WDM links are nothing more than high-capacity pipes (like SONET) waiting for a network to be placed on top of them. Now it is about to change because the tomorrow's optical network will be required to provide on-demand light path services instead of simple raw bandwidth. Therefore service providers must build the infrastructure with configurable optical add-drop multiplexers and large port count optical crossconnects as a first step, and with standardized intelligent management and contol planes including signalling. <p> In this talk I will describe the current issues of optical networks and discuss about our proposed framework of traffic engineering for IP and WDM layers which is joint work with my student, Jinhan Song, and will appear in the Optical Networks magazine. <p> <em> Prof. Saewoong Bahk studied telecommunications networks for his Ph.D. at the Univ. of Pennsylvania in 1991. From 1991 through 1994, he was with the Department of Network Operations Systems at Bell Labs as an MTS where he worked on projects for the development of efficient Network Operation Systems for AT&T Networks. Then he joined the School of Electrical Engineering, Seoul National University in 1994 where he serves as an associate professor. His areas of interest include performance analysis and design of communication networks, resource allocation and traffic control in wired/wireless networks. </em> <p> <hr> <p> <em> The <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/nsl/colloquium.html"> Network Systems Colloquium</a> is sponsored by the <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/nsl">Network Systems Lab</a> at <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/"> Purdue University</a>.
