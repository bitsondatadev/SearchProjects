During 1992/1993 he was Professeur Invit&eacute; at INRIA, Rocquencourt, France. His research interests cover performance evaluation, analysis and design of algorithms, combinatorics, stability problems in computer networks, queueing theory, and applied probability. His recent work is devoted to the probabilistic analysis of algorithms on words and designing efficient (image) data compression schemes. He is also actively involved in establishing computable criteria for stability of large distributed systems.<P> He is a recipient of the Humboldt Fellowship.
