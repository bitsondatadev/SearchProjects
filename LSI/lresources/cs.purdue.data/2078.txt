E. Dunsmore</A><P> Research Assistants: J. Sweitzer, K. Claybrooks<P> Sponsor: NSF<P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width = 100%> <P> <it> Virtual Software Engineering Research Center</it><br> In previous work, we have developed Virtual SERC (VSERC), a prototype of a virtual enterprise on the World-Wide Web. This work included the <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/serc"> VSERC Website</A> itself, facilities for expanding and enhancing the Website, as well as a version of the VSERC Website that may be downloaded by any SERC affiliate or NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center to provide the beginning of and backbone for their company or research center Website.<P> VSERC has become a mechanism for conducting SERC business, a spur for applications-driven software engineering research, and an information source for SERC affiliates and potential affiliates.<P> <it>VSERC Educational Wing</it><br> We are now enhancing VSERC by adding an Educational Wing with the following components: <OL> <LI> Technical Reports from SERC Researchers. <LI> Software Engineering Courseware (course outlines, syllabi, reading material, supplemental material, assignments, quizzes and exams). <LI> Interactive Components (interactive Software Engineering tools and instructor-student interaction mechanisms). <LI> Multi-Media Server Access Facilities (audio, video, and animation from lectures, help sessions, conferences, and symposia). </OL> <it>Continuing VSERC Development</it><br> We are also continuing to maintain VSERC with activities divided into the following categories: <OL> <LI> Continuing development of the VSERC Website (updating current material and adding some additional capabilities). <LI> Improving the accessibility and reliability of VSERC (moving to dedicated server hardware that will increase speed, flexibility, and reliability of the VSERC Website). <LI> Improving interactive capabilities with those who visit the Website and those who want to download VSERC software. <LI> Providing more help for installing, parameterizing, and customizing VSERC software. </OL> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width = 100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
