We use our expertise in analysis and design of algorithms on strings to bring new ideas to bear on data compression problems. Our goal is not only to gain insight into the usefulness of existing schemes for data compression, but also to develop new algorithms for lossless off-line data compression and lossy data compression (on-line and off-line). We point out that to predict dynamic performance of a data compression method (particularly, off-line schemes) one needs information about second-order properties (e.g., the large deviations and limiting distribution of number of phrases in the Lempel-Ziv parsing algorithm, etc.) which we plan to explore during the course of this research. <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
