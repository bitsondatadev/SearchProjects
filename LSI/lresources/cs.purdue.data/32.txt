Her passion for programming dates back to the seventh grade. She has experience as a College of Science Ambassador and interned with both the Purdue Discovery Park and Delphi-Delco Labs in Purdue Research Park. Darshana decided to become a CPP Student Ambassador because of her positive interactions with past ambassadors and the Corporate Partners Program. &quot;When I was a freshman, the social events held by the Department really helped me find my way around what seemed to be a vast sea of opportunities.&quot;</p> <p class="style1"><a href="mailto:moorejn@purdue.edu">Jon Moore</a> is a senior originally from Indianapolis. Dreams of combining his love of programming with his interests in graphic design and music drew Jon to Computer Science at Purdue. He is a graphic designer for both the Exponent and Hall of Music Productions and spent the summer of 2011 interning with Harris Corporation as a software engineer. &quot;I love interacting with people,&quot; Jon said when he sought out the role of CPP Student Ambassador. &quot;I have a high level of enthusiasm for both Purdue and the CS Department.&quot;</p> <p class="style1"><a href="mailto:chancm@purdue.edu">Clarine Chan</a> is a sophomore who fell in love with Computer Science upon joining the Department as a freshman. An international student from Malaysia, Clarine is also involved in a number of music-related organizations at Purdue and has internship experience with LoadOut Technologies in Purdue Research Park. Asked why she chose to become a CPP Student Ambassador, she said, &quot;I love meeting new people! I love listening to their stories, their struggles, their hopes and dreams - and helping them achieve their goals.&quot;</p> <p class="style1">More information about the Corporate Partners Program can be found <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/external_relations/corporate/">here</a> and/or by contacting <a href="mailto:jean@purdue.edu">Jean Jackson</a>, Manager of Corporate Relations.</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table> </div> </body> </html> </html>
