PhD student <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/graduate_students/rileyrd/">Ryan Riley</a>, <a href="http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/jiang/" target="_blank">Prof. Xuxian Jiang</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/faculty/dxu/">Prof. Dongyan Xu</a> received the RAID'08 best paper award for their work entitled &quot;Guest-Transparent Prevention of Kernel Rootkits with VMM-based Memory Shadowing.&quot; The RAID symposium was held September 15-17 at the Massachusetts Institutes of Technology. RAID is the premier conference on research in intrusion detection and response systems.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The paper is about <a href="http://friends.cs.purdue.edu/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=nickle" target="_blank">NICKLE</a>, a system the authors have developed to prevent rootkits from &ldquo;hijacking&rdquo; computers&rsquo; operating systems. A rootkit is a malicious program that seizes control of the very core of an operating system &ndash; the kernel &ndash; and further "installs" unauthorized software that will be difficult to find and remove. The rootkit allows other unauthorized access or behavior to occur &ndash; all hidden from the computer user and administrator. This is a tactic used in many cyber attacks, including botnets.</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Ryan Riley is a PhD student under the direction of Jiang and Xu. His research focuses on operating system security. His current work addresses intrusion detection and prevention using virtualization. </font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Jiang received his PhD in Computer Science from Purdue University, and is currently an assistant professor at <a href="http://www.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">North Carolina State University</a>.
