Blanton, Gomaa, Kumar, Raychowdhury and Upasani were selected from more than 200 applicants. The Intel Foundation Ph.D. Fellowship Program awards two-year fellowships to Ph.D. candidates pursuing leading-edge work in fields related to Intel's business and research interests. Fellowships are available at select U.S. universities, by invitation only, and focus on Ph.D. students who have completed at least one year of study. This is a highly competitive program with approximately 40 fellowships awarded annually. </font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Intel's fellowship program is part of a comprehensive higher education program which focuses on advancing innovation in key areas of technology, as well as developing a pipeline of world-class technical talent for Intel's future workforce and the global knowledge-based economy. To achieve this goal, Intel collaborates with top universities worldwide to expand university curricula, engage in focused research, and encourage student participation in research throughout their education. Intel's higher education support extends to more than 100 universities in 30 countries. </font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To learn more about Intel's commitment to higher education, visit: <a href="http://www.intel.com/education/highered/studentprograms.htm" target="_blank">http://www.intel.com/education/highered/studentprograms.htm</a>. </font></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><font size="-2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Intel is a registered trademark of Intel Corporation or its subsidiaries in the United States and other countries. * Other names and brands may be claimed as the property of others. </font></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="324"><div align="center"></div></td> <td width="414"><div align="center"></div></td> </tr> </table> </body> </html> </html>
