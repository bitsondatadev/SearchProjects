However, when analyzing networks compiled from interaction data over time (e.g., email, co-occurrence in documents), there is inherent uncertainty about the strength of the underlying relationships and/or whether they are still active at a particular point in time, thus it is more accurate to consider the observed interactions at a particular timestep as evidence of latent (i.e., hidden) relationships among entities. In order to model this uncertainty and its effect on network connectivity over time, we will formulate social network measures based on a probabilistic graph formulation. Within this framework, we will then develop change detection methods to identify notable node/link changes over time by modeling normal temporal behavior and identifying significant deviations from the normal profiles. We will also develop tools to estimate the impact of uncertainty on the discovered patterns, where the uncertainty can be inherent in the data or due to the data alignment process. </p> <p class="c2">IARPA Grant FA8650-10-C-7060: $507,555; co-PI; October 2010<br> <br></p> <p class="c2"><strong>Towards Better Modeling of Communication Activity Dynamics in Large-Scale Online Social Networks</strong></p> <p class="c2">Online social networks (OSNs) have witnessed tremendous growth and popularity over the recent years. The huge success and increasing popularity of social networks makes it important to characterize and study their behavior in detail. Recent work in analyzing online social network data has focused primarily on either static social network structure or evolving social networks. However, popular OSNs sites provide mechanisms to form and maintain community over time by facilitating communication, content sharing, and other forms of activities. </p> <p class="c2">This research will develop a suite of algorithmic and analytic methods to support the characterization and modeling of activity networks. In particular, we will conduct static and temporal characterization studies of social network activity, study sampling techniques that can preserve graph properties for different communication activity graphs, investigate the fundamental theoretical trade-offs between preserving different properties of the graph, and develop procedural modeling techniques to generate social network activity graphs to better represent the temporal dynamics and burstiness of activity patterns.</p> <p class="c2">NSF Grant IIS-1017898</a>: $248,226; PI; Sept 2010<br> <br></p> <p class="c2"><strong><a href="http://soihub.org/">Emerging Frontiers of Science of Information</a></strong></p> <p class="c2">The overarching vision of the Center for Science of Information is to develop rigorous principles guiding the extraction, manipulation, and exchange of information, integrating elements of space, time, structure, semantics and context.

Statistical tools have recently been brought to bear on the analysis of graphs, yielding rich dividends in various application areas. The aim of this project is to use tools from statistics and graph theory to develop algorithms that generate similar graphs efficiently. Since graph data is often expensive to collect, it is desirable to synthetically generate graphs. To be widely applicable however, the generated graphs need to both preserve the semantics of the original data (i.e., be drawn from the same distribution) and be efficient to compute.</p> <p class="c2">Two key questions form the core emphasis of the current project. First, how does one measure similarity between two graphs? Second, how can this notion of similarity be used to generate new graphs? On the topic of similarity, the project will investigate representations to preserve global properties, propose new, efficient, representations for signatures, and explore sampling techniques and their convergence behavior. On the topic of generation of new graphs, the project will develop an exponential random graph model using signatures, investigate feature selection via regularization, propose novel methods to sample from the exponential random graph model and novel techniques to produce proposal graphs, and provide rigorous empirical validation across a range of application areas.</p> <p class="c2"><a href="http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~vishy/graphs.html">NSF Grant IIS-0916686</a>: $164,846; co-PI; Sept 2009<br> <br></p> <p class="c2"><strong>Machine Learning Techniques to Model the Impact of Relational Communication on Distributed Team Effectiveness</strong></p> <p class="c2">Although social science research has examined some relational aspects of distributed teams, the approaches that examine the impact of interpersonal communication on team effectiveness are limited by the statistical techniques used for analysis. The goal of this project is to exploit recent advances in the field of machine learning to study relational communication flow in distributed group settings, analyze its impact on effectiveness, and understand the complex interdependencies among group members. We posit that it is the dependencies among team members that hold the key to understanding the organizational and relational processes that impact the success (or failure) of distributed teams.</p> <p class="c2">The project will take an iterative approach to theory formation and refinement based on a combined analysis of large-scale observational data and experimental studies, exploring both the local and global characteristics of communication and its impact on team properties. We will extract and analyze publicly available data from open-source software development projects (e.g., project mailing lists and bug reports) to develop joint models of effectiveness based on relational patterns of communication among members. We will then use the results of this analysis to develop targeted hypotheses for empirical evaluation in laboratory experiments.</p> <p class="c2">NSF Grant SES-0823313: $205,311; PI; Aug 2008<br> <br></p> <p class="c2"><strong>Fusion and Analysis of Multi-Source Relational Data</strong></p> <p class="c2">Although there has been significant progress in recent years developing analysis tools for relational datasets, two critical technical barriers limit the applicability of the models. First, current techniques assume a single-source environment where the relationships among objects are completely observed in the training set. However, in many real-world domains, data is collected from and/or stored in separate sources---each source may record observations for only a subset of the entities or a subset of the relations. Second, current techniques assume unambiguous, precise relational information but in many real-world domains the recorded link structure has uncertainty due to measurement error and/or source reliability. Since relational models improve performance by propagating information throughout the relational graph structure, it is critical to incorporate these uncertainties into the analysis process to limit the influence of erroneous observations.</p> <p class="c2">The main elements of our project focus on three aspects of multi-source analysis: (1) data fusion, (2) learning from data with uncertainty and source information, and (3) evaluation of data and source quality. We will build on past work in entity resolution to develop algorithms to align data from multiple sources and infer the underlying network structure by exploiting the relational links in each data set. We will also extend the models and algorithms we have developed for relational domains to represent and reason with additional source information and confidence levels. Finally, we will develop a framework to reason about the quality of individual sources and the impact of noisy and/or biased link observations on model performance, exploiting our recent work on evaluation techniques that assess errors unique to relational domains. The primary contribution of the work will be the development of efficient and accurate methods to combine data from a variety of sources for knowledge discovery and decision-making support in relational domains.</p> <p class="c2">DARPA/DSO Grant NBCH1080005: $499,877; PI; June 2008<br> <br></p> <p class="c2"><strong>MAASCOM: Modeling, Analysis, and Algorithms for Stochastic Control of Multi-Scale Networks</strong></p> <p class="c2">Current networks security monitoring is often driven by reliance on threshold counts for traffic volumes or alerts. While useful, these do not exploit relationships among network flows. In this project, we are developing methods to learn statistical models for evolving network flows, exploiting not only the relational structure but also the temporal evolution of the network. Although several techniques for learning relational models from network data have been developed recently, research has focused primarily on the task of attribute and link prediction in static domains. In flow domains, the modeling task will need to take the temporal evolution of the data in account, while predicting not only the structure of the network (e.g., which flows are related) but also the occurrence of complex events throughout the network (e.g., a coordinated intrusion across multiple hosts). This necessitates that we move beyond previous assumptions of a static, well-structured domain and develop more elaborate relational models and algorithms.</p> <p class="c2">More specifically, we are developing automated methods to infer the structure of the underlying flow network from flow streams, capitalizing on our experience modeling both static and dynamic relational domains. We aim to move significantly beyond current data mining and machine learning approaches, which would model the flows independently. Instead, we will exploit the relational dependencies hidden in the flow structure, which are induced by the shared underlying network topology and application goals. In addition, we are developing methods to identify the occurrence of complex events that are temporally and topologically distributed in the network. For example, a denial-of-service attack may consist of a single low-capacity flow from one source that diffuses slowly throughout the network and then results a set of distributed high- capacity flows to a target node. Although there are some current efforts to incorporate temporal dynamics into relational models, these approaches make strict Markov assumptions to make the models tractable. We conjecture that more elaborate dependency structures will be necessary to effectively identify distributed patterns in streaming flow data. Thus, instead of using Markov assumptions in our models, we will define and explore a limited model space of temporal-relational motifs.</p> <p class="c2">MURI/ARO Grant W911NF-08-1-0238: $250,000; co-PI; May 2008<br> <br></p> <p class="c2"><strong>Mining Transaction Streams to Infer Semantic Relations</strong></p> <p class="c2">This project focuses on understanding and exploiting the information in large-scale, dynamic relational networks. In a growing number of relational domains, the data record temporal sequences of interactions among entities. For example, in online communities sites such as facebook.com, members continuously visit other members' pages, accessing content, posting comments, and transferring files. These transactional use patterns could be analyzed to infer the nature and strength of relationships among members, which may then in turn be exploited to improve personalization efforts, marketing strategies, and system design.</p> <p class="c2">The goal of the proposed work is to develop automated methods to infer semantic relationships among entities from streams of relational transactions. We conjecture that low-level interactions among entities provide evidence of latent high-level relationships between individuals, and that the patterns of interactions over time can be accurately and efficiently mined to identify relationships that confer homophily. For example, we may have communication events (e.g., phone calls, emails), data access/transfer events (e.g., web browsing, file access), or localization events (e.g., meetings, conferences). These low-level transactions among individuals are easy to observe/record and although a single event does not (necessarily) indicate a meaningful relationship between the participating parties, repeated interactions over time do suggest a strong relationship.</p> <p class="c2">Microsoft Research Gift: $50,000; PI; June 2007</p> <!-- <BR><BR><P><B>Learning Compositional Simulation Models</B> <P>The complex behavior displayed by social, political, and economic systems can arise from surprisingly simple origins. The behavior of such systems often results from the interactions of entities in those systems (e.g., people, organizations, and technologies) that have relatively simple, consistent, and easily described behavior. It is the interactions among those elements over time that produces much of the complexity and variation in the behavior of the system. <P>In this project we are extending recent advances in statistical relational learning to automatically learn components of agent-based models. Research in relational learning has broadened the applicability of machine learning methods to include phenomena arising from interactions among heterogeneous sets of entities. For the first time, machine learning can be integrated with agent-based models to form what we term a compositional model, which will combine components that are learned from data with components that are hand-engineered using traditional methods. This combination will produce powerful tools for understanding the emergent behavior of complex social and organizational systems. <P>IARPA/ARL Grant FA8750-07-2-0158: $396,466; co-PI; April 2007 --> </td> <td class="c2" colspan="1" width="25"></td> <td class="c8" colspan="4" width="100"></td> <td class="c1" width="1"></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="c1" width="1" height="20"></td> <td class="c8" colspan="4" width="100" height="20"></td> <td class="c2" colspan="20" width="500" height="20"></td> <td class="c8" colspan="4" width="100" height="20"></td> <td class="c1" width="1" height="20"></td> </tr> <tr class="c7"> <td colspan="30" height="2"></td> </tr> <tr class="c6"> <td colspan="30" height="50"></td> </tr> <tr> <td class="c1" colspan="30" height="1"></td> </tr> </table> </center> </div> </body> </html> </html>
