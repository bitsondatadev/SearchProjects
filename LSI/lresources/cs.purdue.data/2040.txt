After an introduction that explores Internet growth and trends, the text is divided into five parts that explore: Internet applications and programming, data communications, packet switching with wired and wireless network technologies that includes both local-area and wide-area networks, Internetworking and the TCP/IP protocols used in the Internet. The final section explores aspects of networking that cross multiple layers and technologies, including security and network management. The text covers a wide range of topics, including bridging, switching, routing and routing protocols, multimedia protocols and IP telephony, and Web browsing. The text includes a CD-ROM with a network simulator that allows students to explore properties of protocols without requiring expensive network analyzers or other lab equipment. <BR> The Fifth Edition represents a dramatic reorganization and complete update that responds to suggestions from professors and students. The edition contains several new chapters and updates all the material to use more recent technologies in examples. In addition, a set of animations and exercises, known as CONIC, is available for download at no cost from <A HREF="http://www.tetcos.com/downloadconic.php"> http://www.tetcos.com/downloadconic.php</A>.

In addition to discussing the motivation, architecture, and use of network processors, the text considers protocol processing tasks, and explains how such tasks can be implemented in software or hardware. It covers key concepts such as classification, switching fabrics, processor and memory hierarchies, and programming languages used with network processors. In addition, the text discusses the use of parallelism and pipelining, issues of scale, and the design tradeoffs that underly network processors. The final section of the text presents details of one network processor (the Intel IXP1200), and shows example code for both the embedded processor and packet processors that are part of the Intel chip. <BR> <BR> <UL> <LI> <A HREF="nsd.ch.cover.jpg"> Full-size cover </A> <LI> <A HREF="nsd.chapt.html"> List of chapters (in English)</A> <LI> <A HREF="nsd.cont.html"> Full table of contents (in English) </A> <LI> <A HREF="nsd.quotes.html"> Reviewer's comments </A> <LI> <A HREF="http://www.npbook.cs.purdue.edu"> Web site for the text</A> </UL> <BR> <BR> <DT> <A HREF="tib.cn.cover.jpg"> <IMG SRC="tib.cn.icon.jpg" ALIGN=bottom></A> The Internet Book: Everything you need to know about computer networking and how the Internet works, Paperback, 4th Edition 2008.
