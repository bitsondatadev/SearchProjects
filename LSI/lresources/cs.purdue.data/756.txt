Working jointly with his advisor, Professor Chris Clifton, their work was recognized at the Ninth ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining. This ACM sponsored conference is international known as the leading conference on knowledge discovery and data mining. The ninth ACM SIGKDD was held in Washington, DC, August 24-27, 2003. </font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Professor Clifton and Dr. Vaidya's research paper entitled &quot;Privacy-Preserving K-Means Clustering over Vertically Partitioned Data&quot; received the honorable mention for the best research paper at the conference. Their paper presents a method of sharing data while still maintaining privacy and security of participating sites. Clifton and Vaidya demonstrate how &quot;to implement a standard data mining algorithm with provable privacy and information disclosure properties&quot; in their paper. Focusing on reducing communication costs, their work &quot;ensures reasonable privacy.&quot; A copy of their <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=956750.956776" target="_blank">abstract and paper </a> is available online.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Professor Chris Clifton joined the Purdue University Department of Computer Science in 2001. He received his M.A. from Princeton University in 1988 and his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1991. His research interests are in data mining technology, particularly data mining that respects privacy and security constraints on the underlying data. Professor Clifton's recent work on privacy preserving data mining plays a role in healthcare delivery systems which is a focus of Purdue's recently initiated <a href="http://center.e-enterprise.purdue.edu/wps/portal/.cmd/cs/.ce/155/.s/4175/_s.155/4175" target="_blank">Regenstrief Center for Healthcare Engineering</a>.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dr. Vaidya has accepted a tenure track assistant professor position in the <a href="http://msis.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">Management Science and Information Systems </a> department at <a href="http://www.rutgers.edu" target="_blank">Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey</a>. </font> </p> </div> </td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
