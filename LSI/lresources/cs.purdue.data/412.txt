Szpankowski was an Assistant Professor at the Technical University of Gdansk, and in 1984 he was an Assistant Professor at the McGill University, Montreal. During 1992/1993 he was Professeur Invite&acute at INRIA, Rocquencourt, France. His research interests cover analysis of algorithms, analytic combinatorics, (analytic) information theory, random structures, data compression, algorithms on words, networking, stability problems in distributed systems, modeling of computer systems and computer communication networks, queueing theory, and operations research. His recent work is devoted to the probabilistic analysis of algorithms on words and designing efficient multimedia data compression schemes based on approximate pattern matching. He also tries to establish the so called "analytic information theory" that deals with problems of information theory that are solved by analytic methods in which complex analysis plays a pivotal role. <P> He is a recipient of the Humboldt Fellowship. He has been guest editors for special issues in <i>IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</i>, <i>Theoretical Computer Science</i>, <i>Random Structures &amp Algorithms</i>, and <i>Algorithmica</i>. He is currently a field editor for <i>Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science</i>. <p> <i>Projects:</i> <ul> <li> <A HREF="../research/datacomp.html">Data Compression Based on Approximate Pattern Matching</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/stabcon.html">Stability Considerations for Networks: Asymptotic Behaviors and Limits of Multidimensional Models</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/datacompsop.html">Data Compression from String Matching Perspective: Second Order Properties</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/words/words.html">Analytical Approach to Probabilistic Problems on Words</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/multimeddata.html">Multimedia Data Compression Based on Pattern Matching</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/tait.html">Towards Analytic Information Theory: Data Compression, Prediction and Universal Coding Through Analytic Methods</a> </ul> <P> <A HREF="../publications/spa.html">Recent Publications</a> <P> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/spa"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
