You can work in groups of 2-3, depending on the complexity/magnitude of the project.<BR> <ol> <li>Enhancing the expressiveness of query languages by embedding "mining" functions in SQL etc.<BR> <BR> This would entail, adding more user defined functions/operators that will call a data mining routine that is either written by you or available as a standard off-the-shelf component. Also involves performance evaluation of your implementation. Medium to Heavy Programming.<BR> <BR> <li>Complete, case study of a particular application as a domain for data mining. This would involve feasibility analysis, data cleaning and deciding on the right tool/software to use, conducting data mining and reporting/visualization of the results. Light programming.<BR> <BR> <li>Research into the design/improvement of a specific data mining algorithm or dwelving into parallelization of an existing algorithm. Would need to generate datasets for performance evaluation and conduct comparative results. Medium Programming.<BR> <BR> <lI>Any ideas for theoretical/analytic work that lies at the intersection of one or more sub areas/sub disciplines of data mining and its constituent topics.<BR> <BR> <li>Integration of data mining systems into several kinds of "host" environments. Tight coupling of inductive functionality into existing applications. Preferably using a commercial RDBMS or OLAP tool. Medium to Heavy programming.<BR> <BR> <li>"Closing the loop" - Data Mining is never a single step, rather an iterative process involving several modules. Novel ideas and suggestions for building a closed loop data mining system are also welcome. Medium programming. Would involve interfacing tools with one another.<BR> <BR> </ol> </P> <HR NOSHADE SIZE=2> </P> <A HREF="../index.html"><IMG SRC="../images/returnhome.gif" ALT="Return Home" BORDER=0></A> </BODY></HTML> </BODY></HTML>
