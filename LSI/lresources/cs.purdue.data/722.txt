The intent was to experimentally demonstrate that a heterogeneous network environment could be viewed as a massively parallel processor for a variety of computations, in particular for simulation and domain-specific computations. Using a few simple but pragmatic rules, we designed and built a fault-tolerant software environment for network-based computing. The EcliPSe project was awarded the 1992 Gordon Bell Prize for price/performance, based on a superconcurrent polymer chain simulation which simultaneously utilized about 200 heterogeneous machines dispersed across the U.S. <P> For more information please see <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/PaCS/PaCS.html"> http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/PaCS/PaCS.html</a> <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
