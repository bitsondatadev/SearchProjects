Catlin<P> Sponsor: NSF <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <P> Computational science and computational engineering require addressing the fundamental challenge of harnessing high-performance computing equipment and exploiting it through very high level systems that are problem-oriented. Such systems require a wide range of expertise plus a flexible and diverse array of equipment. This laboratory provides infrastructure facilities that serve the needs for basic research broadly focused on building problem-solving environments for applied, experimental work for computational science. The facilities include: <UL> <LI> High-performance graphics processors to support scientific visualization, geometric modeling and design, and multimedia graphical user. <LI> <a href="../research/cse/hpc-pses"> High-performance computers</a>. <LI> Software and development support staff assisting application researchers. <LI> This laboratory is the principal facility of the interdisciplinary graduate degree program in Computational Science and Engineering. </UL> The focus of <a href="../research/cse/softlab/softlab.html"> SoftLab</a> is to create a laboratory, with a software layer above the familiar "physical" wet and dry laboratories of science and engineering. The project builds the needed software and algorithmic infrastructure for some of the important activities in a lab and produces the electronic analog of a scientific laboratory environment for important applications. <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
