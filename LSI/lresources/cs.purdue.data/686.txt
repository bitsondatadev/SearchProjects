His research interests include problem solving environments, computational finance, parallel/neural/mobile computing, performance evaluation and modeling, expert systems for scientific computing, numerical analysis, and distributed learning. He is the co-editor of several proceedings in the areas of "supercomputing" and "expert systems for scientific computing," a member IFIP working group 2.5 in numerical software and in the editorial board of Neural, Parallel and Scientific Computations and HPC Users Journals. He served as acting head of the computer sciences department at Purdue during the 1987-88 and 1993-94 academic years, and as associate head for several years. <P> Projects: <UL> <LI> <A HREF="../research/neuralcomp.html">Neural Computing</A> <LI> <A HREF="../research/softlab.html">SoftLab--A Laboratory for Computational Science</A> <LI> Computational Science and Engineering Program <LI> Distributing Computations in Multiprocessor Systems <LI> <A HREF="../research/hpcpde.html">High-Performance Computing (HPC) Methods and Systems for Partial Differential Equations (PDE)</A> <LI> <A HREF="../research/pamecosy.html">Parallel Methods and Collaborating Systems for Solving Partial Differential Equations</A> <LI> <A HREF="../research/pdesks.html>PDE Solving Kernels and Systems for Scalable MIMD Multiprocessors</A> <LI> <A HREF="../research/pdelab.html">PDELab: Problem Solving Environments and Methods for the Development of PDE-Based Applications on Parallel Machines</A> <LI> <A HREF="../research/pythia.html">PYTHIA: An Expert System for PDE-Based Application Problem Solving Environments</A> <LI> <A HREF="../research/sciencepad.html">SciencePad</A> <LI> <A HREF="../research/ellpack.html">ELLPACK System</A> </UL> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/enh"> Houstis's homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
