The result would be a shared vision across the university<br /> and a strategic plan to achieve that vision.&quot;</p> </li> <li> <p>&quot;The Dean of the College of Science and the Provost should<br /> declare that consideration of the single issue of realignment of the Computer<br /> Science Department into the College of Engineering is closed. They should<br /> carefully communicate that while the realignment proposal does have some<br /> positive attributes, the process for consideration of this singleton realignment<br /> issue is no longer functional and is terminated. Computer Science should<br /> participate in the pan-university process of repositioning the university to best<br /> embrace and exploit computer science and information technology for education<br /> and research, should it commence.&quot;</p> <br /> The above two recommendations seem to be very positive for Computer Science, and in general to computing, at Purdue. First, the committee has gone far beyond the realignment proposal. The recommendation above, and several other statements in the report, are a clear indication that the committee thinks that all elements of computing at Purdue, including CompE, CS, C&amp;IT, and CG&amp;T, ought to be included in a broad discussion that must lead to a strategic plan that focuses on bringing computing as a single university wide source for education and research. <br /> <br /> Let us hope that the President and the Provost take the committee recommendation with utmost seriousness and establish a university-wide committee to arrive at a strategic plan. What exactly will be the outcome of any such committee and the discussions that ensue, is unclear. But one outcome seems obvious: the face of CompE and CS at Purdue is destined to change for the better, and, in all likelihood CS will not remain a part of the College of Science.<br /> <br /> Alll faculty and students who supported the realignment proposal ought to be congratulated for communicating the need for realignment to the External Review committee. <span class="Red">Dean Roberts had explicitly asked the committee NOT to look into the realignment issue.</span> The committee did refer to this fact in their report. Nevertheless, many brave souls in CS went ahead and brought the issue to the forefront during the committee's visit. Also, following their visit the committee talked with Aditya. The committee finally recommended what many on CS faculty have been thinking for years: a single face of computing at Purdue!<br /> <br /> It is also interesting to note that all the issues that led to the realignment proposalin 2008 are mentioned in the report. For example, the question of the merger of ECE and CS, the divide between CompE and CS, the problems that student's face, course overlap, etc., are all in the report. It is exactly these issues that led the committee to recommend burying the realignment proposal in its current form and morph it into a new and much broader realignment across the university!<span class="Red">Obviously, the realignment issue will remain very much alive though in a much stronger and broader form! </span><br /> <br /> A big <span class="Red">Thank You </span> to all members of the External Review committee and all CS faculty who have expressed their steadfast support to the realignment and their concern for the betterment of the future of our students and of Purdue! </li> </ol></td></li> </tr> <tr> <td height="432" valign="top">Friday May 13, 2011</td> <td align="left" valign="top">Thanks to the persistence of CS faculty, students, alumni and the report of the External Review Committee, Purdue administration has finally taken a decision.

Thus, one wonders how the committee members' views on realignment will affect the final recommendations of the search committee. <br /> <br /> One member of the search committee is known to go his way if the committee's decision is not agreeable to him. Several years ago, whlie serving on an important committee, he disagreed with the majority decision and wrote his own repor, with another member of that committee, while the committee chair wrote the majority report. <p>Given that the university has not taken any final decision on the realignment issue, and that this issue has created a tense atmosphere among departmental faculty, one wonders whether this is the right time to invite candidates from outside for an interview! </p></td> </tr> <tr> <td height="145" valign="top">Wednesday September 14, 2011</td> <td align="left" valign="top">Aditya sent a<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/apm/Realignment/President9.14.2011.pdf"> letter</a> to President Cordova requesting that the CS head search be postponed until after the Provost has set up the task force he promised to CS faculty and staff and after the task force has announced its recommendations.

It is worth noting that the August 2006 report of the review committee titled &quot;Strategic Plan Review&quot; is public and accessible via the Internet. Also available is the External Review Committee Report Physics Department, School of Physics and Astronomy University of Minnesota (from where Dean Roberts came to Purdue). Many such reports are made public, and ought to be made public. However, for some unknown reason, Dean Roberts has decided not to make the report public. Below is a relevant extract from the College of Science Policies and Procedures Manual (note theuse of the term &quot;full department&quot;):</p> <p>&quot;10. The final written report should be submitted to the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs<br /> within approximately one month of the site visit. The report should be public in nature, so<br /> that it may be circulated to the full Department.
