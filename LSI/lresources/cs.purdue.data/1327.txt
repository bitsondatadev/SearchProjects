In case you cannot make it to the class or you are using your extra days, you can submit by-email. Please email the TA a copy of your homework, by 3PM the day the homework is due. <LI>Every student has three extra days in total.&nbsp; If you are using extra days, the day ends at 3PM. Any portion of a day used counts as one day.<LI>If you are not sure that you understood what the homework asks you to solve, please email/see the instructor or the TA for clarifications. <LI>Homeworks are returned in class. All uncollected homeworks can be picked up from the instructor (email me first or stop during office hours) </LI> --> </ul> <h3><font color="#000080">Academic Integrity</font></h3> <P>Academic Honesty and Ethical behavior are required in this course, as it is in all courses at Purdue University. The class will be conducted according to the <A href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/homes/spaf/cpolicy.html">policy</A> written by Professor Gene Spafford. Please take the time to read it carefully. This will be followed unless the instructor provides written documentation of exceptions. </P> <P>Students are encouraged to talk with the instructor about any questions you have about what is permitted on any particular assignment.</P> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE> <HR> &nbsp;</BODY></HTML>
