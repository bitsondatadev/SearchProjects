<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE>Don't be Disappointed!</TITLE> </HEAD> <BODY> <H2>Don't lose out on Greg N. Frederickson's book, <BR> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/gnf/book3.html"><i> Piano-hinged Dissections: Time to Fold!</i></A> </H2> <blockquote> I was surprised when I saw that British Library Direct was selling, for &pound;17.14 + &pound;7.65 (shipping), my article "Piano-Hinged Dissections: Now Let's Fold!", a 13-page article which appeared in Springer's Lecture Notes in Computer Science volume 2866, which contains papers from the Japanese Conference on Discrete and Computational Geometry, JCDCG 2002. </blockquote> <blockquote> I hope that no one will order this article thinking that they will receive my book <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/gnf/book3.html"><i> Piano-hinged Dissections: Time to Fold!</i></A>, A K Peters, 2006. </blockquote> <blockquote> It is particularly disappointing that Springer and British Library Direct would sell my article outside of the volume for the conference, and that they would sell those 13 pages for a sum that is just 2 British pounds less than the discounted price of my whole book on amazon.co.uk . (My book contains over 300 pages and is accompanied by an hour-long video on a CD.) </blockquote> <!<blockquote> <! Just how shameless and greedy are Springer and British Library Direct? </blockquote> <HR size=3> <I>Last updated October 11, 2007.</I> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
