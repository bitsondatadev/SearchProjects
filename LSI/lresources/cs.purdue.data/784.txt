The method applies the 3D Zernike descriptors, a mathematical series expansion, which was previously shown to be effective in comparing protein surface shapes by the Kihara group. They further applied the method for comparing low-resolution electron microscopy density maps.</p> <p class="style1">The related server for structure database search, 3D-Surfer, is available at the <a href=http://kiharalab.org/3d-surfer/>Kihara lab</a>. </p> <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p> <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table> </div> </body> </html> </html>
