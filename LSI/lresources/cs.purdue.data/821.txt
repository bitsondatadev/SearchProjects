D., University of Wisconsin-Madison, 1990</EM><P> Dr. Peters is interested in representing and analyzing geometry on the computer. He has developed new tools for free-form modeling and design that can be viewed as a language for describing geometric entities, curves and surfaces, in a succinct form. Efficient, exact representation of geometry is fundamental to scientific visualization, animation and graphics, virtual reality, virtual prototyping of manufacturable objects, etc. For examples, please see <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jorg/res.html"> http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jorg/res.html</a>.<P> In 1994, Dr. Peters was honored with a five year National Young Investigator Award. In 1991 and 1992 he held positions at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.<P> <p> <i>Labs:</i> <ul> <li> <a href="../facilities/labs/surflab.html">SurfLab</a> </ul> <i>Projects:</i> <ul> <li> <A HREF="/research/fountool.html">Foundations and Tools for Surface Modeling</A> </ul> <P> <A HREF="../publications/jorg.html">Recent Publications</A> <P> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/jorg"> Personal Homepage</A> <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
