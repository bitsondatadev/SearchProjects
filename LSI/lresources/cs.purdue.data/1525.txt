It is <font color="#FF0000">the student's</font> responsibility to manage their time so that the assignments can be submitted before the deadline. <p><i>Academic Dishonesty</i> <p>We wish to foster an open and collegial class environment. At the same time, we are <em>vigorously</em> opposed to academic dishonesty because it seriously detracts from the education of honest students. Because of this, we have the following standard policy on academic honesty, consistent with Purdue University's official policy. <ul> <li> It is permissible to discuss a general method of solution with other students, or to make use of reference materials in the library or online. If you do this, you will be expected to clearly disclose with whom you discussed the method of solution, or to cite the references used. Failure to do so will be considered cheating or plagiarism. The use of "method of solution" means a general discussion of technique or algorithm, such as one would reasonably expect to occur standing in front of a whiteboard, and precludes the detailed discussion of code or written assignments. Specifically, looking at another student's code on his/her computer monitor is NOT allowed.</li> <li> Unless otherwise explicitly specified, all written assignments or code that is submitted is to be entirely the students own work. Using any code or copying any assignment from others is strictly prohibited without advance prior permission from the instructor. This includes the use of code others have submitted in the past.</li> <li> All students work is their own. Students who do share their work with others are <i>as</i> responsible for academic dishonesty as the student receiving the material. Students are not to show work to other students, in the class or not. Students are responsible for the security of their work and should ensure that printed copies are not left in accessible places, and that file/directory permissions are set to be <em>unreadable</em> to others (e.g. use "chmod -R 700 *" from your home directory). If you need assistance protecting your work, please contact your TA or instructor.</li> <li> Students who encourage others to cheat or plagiarize, or students who are aware of plagiarism or cheating and do not report it are also participating in academically dishonest behavior.</li> <li> Be aware that we will use a software tool called <a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/">MOSS (http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/)</a> to check for copying among submitted assignments. Additionally, the instructor and TA will be inspecting all submitted material to ensure honesty.</li> </ul> <blockquote><i><font color="#990000">Any case of academic dishonesty will be dealt with by a severe grade penalty in the <b>overall </b>class grade and referral to the office of the Dean of Students.</font></i></blockquote> <p> <em> Classroom Policy </em><P> Class participation and discussions are strongly encouraged. However, please be considerate to others: avoid coming to class late, leaving early, talking to other students, etc. Please turn off your cell phone before the class starts. <p> <em> Emergency Policy </em><P> In the event of a major campus emergency, course requirements, deadlines and grading percentages are subject to changes that may be necessitated by a revised semester calendar or other circumstances. Any changes will be posted to the course web page. <p> <H3> Counseling: </H3><P> If you are experiencing personal problems or stress, Purdue provides counseling services through the Purdue CAPS Center. See <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/CAPS/">https://www.purdue.edu/CAPS/</a> for more details. <p> <A NAME="mailing"> <H3> Discussion group: </H3><P> Questions/comments should be posted on the discussion forum on <A href="https://blackboard.purdue.edu/webct/logon/8056011">blackboard</a>. <br> <EM>Make sure that you check the discussion group and your Purdue e-mail <A HREF="../cs422/email.gif">frequently (at least once or twice per day)</A>. Please do NOT post answers to the assignments, though posting general clarifications is fine. Complaints about the assignments or the class should NOT be posted to the group-- instead, they should be e-mailed to the instructor.</EM> <A NAME="links"> <P><H3>Useful Links:</H3><P> <UL> <LI><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/fahmy/links.html">Networking/OS/DS tools and research links</A> <P> <LI> <A HREF="http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/esc1.html">A quick introduction to statistics</a> | <A HREF="http://www.irisa.fr/sisthem/kniga/">More statistical methods</a> <P> <LI> <A HREF="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs140/info/c++-anderson.pdf">A quick introduction to C++ by Tom Anderson</a> | <A HREF="http://www.strath.ac.uk/IT/Docs/Ccourse">A quick introduction to C by Steve Holmes</a> <P> </UL> <P> <HR> <A href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/fahmy">Back to Sonia Fahmy's home page</A> <br> <P> <ADDRESS>Created by: Sonia Fahmy &lt;<A HREF="mailto:fahmy@cs.purdue.edu">fahmy@cs.purdue.edu</A>&gt;<BR> January 4th, 2010 </ADDRESS><BR> <ADDRESS>Last updated by: Sonia Fahmy &lt;<A HREF="mailto:fahmy@cs.purdue.edu">fahmy@cs.purdue.edu</A>&gt;<BR> February 10th, 2010 </ADDRESS> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
