To expand the ways that students interact with computers and computer science, the Department of Computer Science has developed a summer camp program for middle-school aged youth. </font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">response to this limited exposure to computer science, the Department of Computer Science has developed a summer camp program for middle-school aged youth. </font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/05precamp2.jpg" width="382" height="283" align="right">Specific objectives include exposure to careers in computer science, increasing problem-solving skills, building awareness of the importance of math and science in preparing for a career in computer science, and increasing awareness of our K-12 outreach services that are available. Additionally, a second level camp has been developed for students wishing to continue the pursuit of computer science knowledge. </font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Campers will be housed on Purdue's campus in Cary Residence Hall and registration fees cover all meals, “fun night,” admission to the recognition luncheon, and all materials. Activities are led by Mindy Hart , Purdue University Computer Science K-12 Outreach Coordinator and Judith Lewandowski, Assistant Professor of Instructional Technology, Indiana University South Bend. </font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="images/05precamp4.jpg" width="262" height="315" align="left">The Beginner Camp runs June 19-22, and will focus on programming using Lego Robotics and Web Page design. Beginner campers should be comfortable using a computer. </font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Advanced Camp runs June 22-25 and takes a more in-depth look at Robotics and web design. Campers should have attended a previous session of the Computer Science Summer Camp or have some computer programming and Web page design experience.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> Parents who register their middle-school children before June 1st will receive a discounted rate of $275.
