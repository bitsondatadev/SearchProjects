<TITLE>SciencePad</TITLE> <!-- Changed by: Ranjeewa Weerasinghe, 6-Oct-1995 --> <H2> <IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="gifs/head.gif"> An Intelligent, Mobile Electronic Notebook</H2> <HR> <P> <H3>Introduction</H3> <i>The National Information Infrastructure (NII) that will evolve in the 1990's and beyond will impact many institutions of life. These include the way we learn and do science, self-caring, access to civil/information infrastructure systems &services, and management &control of manufacturing processes. The future scenario for NII assumes wireless networks used by walkstations realizing the dream of truly ubiquitous access of the national information superhighway. Some of the current obstacles in building such a ubiquitous access system on mobile high-performance platforms include the user interface for these walkstations, the ability of sniffing information across heterogeneous geographically distributed information systems, the ability of processing sensoring data for monitoring and control, and the dynamic reconfigurability of computations between the mobile unit and the stationary servers. Our effort in the area of ubiquitous computing, the <B>SciencePad</B> project, involves the design and implementation of intelligent models and techniques to address the aforementioned obstacles. <P> </i><P> <HR> <IMG SRC="gifs/nii.gif"> <B>A 90's view of the NII</B><P> SciencePad involves the design and development of a software system which will be characterized by its intelligent user interface for accessing the NII via mobile platforms. This interface will be multimodal and synergetic, and will have the ability to access information spread across heterogeneous data and knowledge bases connected to the NII. <HR> <IMG SRC="gifs/classroom.gif"> <B>Classroom of the Future</B><P> The advent of mobile and ubiquitous computing, in conjunction with multimedia, high performance computing, and high speed communication backbones, shall bring about a new paradigm that will strongly influence the way teaching is done. <B>SciencePad</B> is being used in developing the classroom of the future. A room in the CS building has been designated for this purpose, and is being used this semester to teach a class in <A HREF="/homes/joshi/courses/mobile/info.html">Mobile Computing</A>. <HR> <H3>Areas</H3> Work on SciencePad involves research into various areas of Computer Science.
