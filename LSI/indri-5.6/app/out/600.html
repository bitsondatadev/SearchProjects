Sirbu<P> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%><p> The Bond system supports a parallel virtual environment. It allows execution of parallel programs on sequential machines, clusters of sequential systems, and massively parallel systems. The Bond system consists of: (a) the Bond shell able to execute a set of Bond commands, (b) Resource databases, (c) A knowledge processing system, (d) A set of utilities. Bond relies on several resource databases to identify the target host and the desired program. Such databases are created when the Bond shell is started for the first time. The Bond shell recognizes a set of Bond commands which allow the user to select resources and to start the execution of shared or private programs. Shared programs are used by a group of users and can be located using the shared program database. Private programs can be located using the private program database. The knowledge processing system supports additional processing steps necessary in a distributed environment like: program and data staging, and/or extraction of relevant facts after running a program. <P> For more information please see <a href="http://tismana.cs.purdue.edu:9020/">The Bond Server</a> <p> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> </body> </html> </html>
