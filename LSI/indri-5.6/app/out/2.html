Nataraj, C. Schuba <P> Sponsors: <a href="coast.html">COAST</a> Laboratory sponsors <P> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%><p> The next generation of networks now being deployed and developed have some significant differences from today's common networks. This includes higher-bandwidth and transmission speeds, virtual circuit protocols, and provision for different qualities of service. However, those new technologies will also require security services to protect hosts using them. <P> This project is intended to design security services in support of these new technologies. The initial focus is on defining the characteristics of a firewall for such an environment. This includes investigation of end-to-end authentication mechanisms, particularly for high-speed networks such as ATM. Future research includes examination of how to enhance audit and monitoring to adequately support services such as misuse and intrusion detection. <P> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> </body> </html> </html>
