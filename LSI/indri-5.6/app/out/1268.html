This is an emerging cross-disciplinary field whose rapid growth is driven by advances in computational geometry, computer graphics, and virtual reality that support powerful new analysis and visualization techniques on large complex data models. The center supports the many faculty who perform image analysis and large scale data analysis, and promotes the university goals of interdisciplinary education and research. Two current research topics are computer modeling of human joints and computer aided design of micromechanical systems. <P> Click <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/visctr/">here</a> for more information and for online publications. <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> =100%>
