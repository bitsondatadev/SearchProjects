The program constructs phase diagrams, which represent the steady-state behavior over a range of initial conditions, and bifurcation diagrams, which represent the changes in steady-state behavior over a range of parameter values. It displays the diagrams symbolically and graphically. The program has solved an open problem in cardiology and corrected mistaken analyses in major journals.<P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
