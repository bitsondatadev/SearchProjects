CONNECT is designed to enable high school females to dive into the world of computer science by interacting with current students, stretching their creativity with a fun computing project, and learning about careers in CS. </p> <p class="style1">&ldquo;Students are drawn to our program because of the tight-knit social community within the department, a CS curriculum built upon fundamentals, the availability of internships and job opportunities, and the support given to our female students through organizations such as CSWN (<em>Computer Science Women's Network)</em>,&rdquo; says Mindy Hart, outreach coordinator for the Department of Computer Science. &ldquo;CONNECT is a great event for those wanting to explore computer science and the impact computer science can have on everyday events and items in the world around us.&rdquo;</p> <p class="style1">Computer scientists have the knowledge and skills to solve tomorrow&rsquo;s problems. The student&rsquo;s creativity and ingenuity can make a difference in healthcare, revolutionize our educational system, strengthen national security, create social networks, and more. &nbsp;Consider the field of computer science to be a part of life changing innovations, utilizing the latest technologies, and cutting edge discoveries.</p> <p class="style1">Women&rsquo;s representation in the computer science workforce is growing. According to the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT) 56% of Advanced Placement (AP) test-takers in 2008 were high school females, and 17 % of those were Computer Science test-takers. The NCWIT also states that by 2018, 1.4 million computer specialist positions will be available. The fact of the matter is that computer science is one of the most in-demand careers out of college. <br /> <br /> The event is free, but students must register quickly since space is limited. The event runs from 9a.m. to 4 p.m., and will be located in the Lawson Computer Science Building on the Purdue, West Lafayette, campus. No prior computer experience is required! Parents and guidance counselors are welcome to attend, and are invited to a special session while the students participate in a computing project.
