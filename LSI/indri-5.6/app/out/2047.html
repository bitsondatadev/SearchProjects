This provides application programs with transparent access to system and remote objects distributed throughout a network of machines. The current implementation runs on the Sun SPARC family of machines and on the Encore Multimax multiprocessor.<P> We feel that o<A NAME=MARKER-10-131></A>bject-oriented programming is an ideal approach to use in the construction of distributed systems. Object-oriented design techniques and programming stress modularity and data encapsulation through narrow and rigidly defined interfaces as a way of achieving low <EM>coupling</EM> between individual software components. Coupling measures the interdependencies between components. Low coupling is a desirable feature for systems because it increases the degree to which components can be modified, updated or replaced without affecting users of the component. Unfortunately, object-oriented interfaces are usually only accessible and enforced through specific languages or homogeneous systems. This severely limits the degree to which disjoint, unrelated components can interact in a multilingual, distributed environment. <P> <EM>Renaissance</EM> is focusing on overcoming these limitations. In particular, we are building a system which provides the ability for unrelated applications written in a variety of programming languages to obtain access to objects distributed throughout a network of machines and implemented in a variety of manners. To achieve our goals we create a first class description of an object's interface which has a runtime realization and is independent of any programming language or system. We provide translators for this description into a variety of languages and systems. These descriptions are used to generate language-specific interfaces to remote objects dynamically at runtime. The descriptions also allow flexible but complete interface specification providing both increased encapsulation and documentation.<P> For more information, please see <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/Renaissance">http://www.cs.purdue.edu/Renaissance</A><A NAME=MARKER-10-134></A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <ADDRESS>CS Annual Report - 19 APR 1996</ADDRESS> <A HREF="AR95Book-121.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bnext.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-119.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bprev.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-66.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bup.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Btop.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bcontent.gif"></A><BR><A HREF="AR95Book-121.html">[Next] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-119.html">[Previous] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-66.html">[Up] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html">[Top] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html">[Contents]</A> <P> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
