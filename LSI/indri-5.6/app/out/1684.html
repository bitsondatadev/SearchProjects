It should provide plenty of information.&nbsp; You can access it <a href="images/Presentation.ppt">here.</a>&nbsp; Also, if you would like to see our users manual, you can access it <a href="images/mp3Player.doc">here.</a></p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center">Why SpeechP3?</p> <p align="center">So the obvious next question is why do we need this?&nbsp; How lazy are we that we can't lift up a finger and click on then next track button when a song comes on that you don't like?&nbsp; First of all, the answer is very lazy.&nbsp; But this is not the only reason SpeechP3 was created.&nbsp; It was mainly created for situations where your hands would be occupied doing something else, and the computer might even be all the way across the room.&nbsp; So it might become handy, for instance, if you're cooking or cleaning and want to listen to music at the same time.&nbsp; Its quite a nuisance to go all the way over to your computer when a bad song comes on, and also your hands might be saturated in cooking supplies.&nbsp; Another good use for this would be if you're exercising, and you are using both your hands, but all the sudden Chumbawumba's &quot;Tub-Thumping&quot; comes on your player.&nbsp; On one hand , you don't want to get up and stop exercising, and on the other, your hands will be too tightly clamped over your ears to click the next button anyways.&nbsp; So all you have to do is say &quot;Computer, Next&quot; and you'll be in the clear again.&nbsp; And one other very important use for our program would be to install it into cars.&nbsp; Accidents are caused every year by drivers who do too many things at the same time, and our application would help reduce this multi tasking by taking care of media controls.</p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center">Who is SpeechP3?</p> <p align="center">SpeechP3 consists of the two brightest minds in all of Computer Science teamed up for the first time ever; Bill Wolfe and Nick Peine.&nbsp; After solving the infamous P = NP problem, Bill has decided that he wants some more challenging work, and that is why he has joined SpeechP3.&nbsp; Nick on the other hand found his PHD work at MIT to be too easy, and that is why he came to Purdue to work on SpeechP3.&nbsp; If you would like to see pictures of our members, you can click on the links below.</p> <p align="center"><a href="images/speech1.jpg">Professional Picture</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="images/speech2.jpg">Not-So-Professional Picture</a></p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center">So at this point I'm sure you're all ready to get using the App!&nbsp; In order to do so, click on the link below to download our work.&nbsp; Included will be all our sources, and an installer to get you started.&nbsp; If you need help on the installation process, look below for instructions.</p> <p align="center"><a href="images/speechp3.zip">SpeechP3 Project</a></p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center">Download the zip file above and extract it using your favorite (or least favorite if you are so inclined) zip program. Wherever you extract it, there should be a setup sub-directory. To install SpeechP3, you should go into said directory and run the setup.exe program. It will then ask you where you would enjoy SpeechP3 to be located on your computer, and then install it there. The setup program will also add a link to your Start menu and your Desktop.</p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> <p align="center">The source code is also available from the aforementioned zip file. Instead of the setup sub-directory, try looking in the source one. From there, you can run the Visual Studio Solution file, or look at the C# code directly.</p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p> </body> </html> </html>
