The crosspoint project is researching the problems in constructing such a system. It is not hard to envision an environment in which students carry small, portable computers that can be used, for example, to take notes during a lecture and to later edit and cross reference these notes with other on-line classroom material. Wireless network technology makes it possible to use the same computers to access this information in a library, class room, dorm room, or any place on campus. Such technology can enhance the ability of an instructor to interact with students both inside and outside of class. <P> The solutions being investigated involve combining wireless network technology with high-speed Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switching technology. The combination should provide a wireless communication system with sufficient aggregate bandwidth to handle both data transfers and routing updates for a university sized network. Specific problems being researched include the particularly difficult problems of using wireless communication on a university campus and routing update mechanisms that can handle the routing of wireless traffic across a large campus. <P> We have implemented a prototype system. The system allows students with a wireless portable PC to access the Internet while roaming in the Computer Science Building. The following overview paper provides a detailed description of the prototype: <P> <A HREF="ftp://gwen.cs.purdue.edu/pub/lin/expoint.ps"> ftp://gwen.cs.purdue.edu/pub/lin/expoint.ps </A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
