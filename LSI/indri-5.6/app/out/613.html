WICS is designed for high school females to learn about careers in CS, meet current students, and stretch their creativity with a fun computing project. Register at <a href="http://outreach.cs.purdue.edu/register">http://outreach.cs.purdue.edu/register</a> to join other girls who love computers.</span></p> <p class="style1">Computer science is a great fit for students who enjoy solving problems and want to make a difference in the world. Computer scientists have the knowledge and skills to solve tomorrow's problems. Their creativity and ingenuity help improve healthcare, revolutionize our educational system, strengthen national security, create social networks, shape public policies, and more. </p> <p class="style1">No prior computer experience is required! Parents and guidance counselors are welcome to attend, and are invited to a special session while the students participate in the computing project. The program is free, and will run from 9:15 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. in the Lawson Computer Science Building on the Purdue University, West Lafayette campus.
