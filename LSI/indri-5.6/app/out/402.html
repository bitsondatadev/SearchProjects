If you submit more than one form, only the one submitted last will be used. You can thus effectively withdraw your application by submitting a form with only the first five items completed. We use UTAs regularly in CS 11000, 15800, 15900, 17700, 18000, 19100, and 23500 and occasionally in other courses. <HR> The first five items on the form are required. PAY ATTENTION TO FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS. Items not properly formatted may be ignored or cause the whole application to be ignored. You are welcome to enter on the form the URL, if you have one, of your resume, especially if you are applying for CS 15900. Use the items Course 1, Course 2, ..., to indicate your preferences for assignment and, if you have completed the course, your grade. You are encouraged to list courses that are not among your preferences but show your background. Here is the format that you must use: Preference,Course,Grade,Term Taken Include all three, and no other, commas. Preference For each course, use 1 for strong preference, 2 for moderate preference, 3 for weak preference, or nothing if you are listing the course only as background. Course Include only Purdue courses. All course numbers now consist of five digits. If you took the course prior to fall 2008, append "00" to the three digits used then. For variable-title courses like CS 49000, add the instructor's initials or last name. For CS courses, enter only the course number: omit the subject (CS). If you took the course more than once, use only the most recent grade. If you have not completed the course, enter nothing for the grade. Term Taken Use FA09 for fall 2009, SP10 for spring 2010, SU10 for summer 2010, etc. Examples 3,11000,, 1,23500,A,FA09 ,35200,B,SP10 ,49000 Lastname,A+,SP10 ,49000 FML,B-,SP10 ,ECE 26400,A,FA09 Non-CS courses that you might include, especially if you are applying for CS 15900, are ECE 26400, 36400, 36800, 36900, 46200, and 46300. The order in which you list the courses is irrelevant. Selecting the ">>" in the lower right corner of the form submits the form. <HR> If you do not know whether you have obtained a position, go to LWSN 1137 or call 494-6004 on the first day of classes. The information you provide may be made available to course staffs.
