If our use of networks and computers is to grow beyond mere research support and technical fad, we will need to find ways of protecting the privacy of computer users, the integrity of important data, and the continued operation of essential services. Complicating the situation is the vast installed base of existing systems and pro tocols, few of which were designed with security as even a secondary goal. Effective security will need to be interoperable with the installed base of computing resources, and cost-effective to employ. COAST is an "umbrella" for research into practical, applied security methods that make sense in existing, everyday computing environments. Our work involves multi-disciplinary efforts to find new tools and technologies to make computing and networks more trustworthy. We are investigating approaches that can be applied immediately and cost-effectively, and that will work in a wide variety of commercial legacy systems. Our sponsors provide feedback and direction, as well as beta sites for testing prototypes and gathering research data. <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/coast/coast.html">Coast Homepage</A><P> <A HREF="ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub">ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub </A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
