Make sure your pseudocode has a complexity of O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the leaf. <li> Write a pseudocode for computing the depth of each node in a tree. Make sure your code runs in O(n) time where n is the depth of the tree. <li> Illustrate the heap after insertion of each of the following entries: <br> 4, 5, 6, 15, 9, 7, 20 <br> <li> Insert the following sequence into a binary search tree and illustrate the tree after each insertion: <br> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 <br> <li> Insert the following sequence into an AVL tree and illustrate the tree after each insertion: <br> 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 <br> <li> Illustrate a skip list and the search of key 32 in the following sequence. Assume that at each level we link alternate entries from previous level. <br> 12 4 43 7 99 65 68 1 <br> <li> Assume that we use the hash function h(x) = (5x + 3) mod 13 to hash into a table of size 13. Illustrate the table after the insertion of the following sequence: <br> 1, 7, 23, 12, 6, 5 <br> Assume that collisions are resolved by chaining. </ul> </body></html> </body></html>
