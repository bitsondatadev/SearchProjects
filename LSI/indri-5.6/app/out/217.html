Middle-school aged students have become experienced at navigating the Internet and applying various educational software packages, but the field of computer science offers so much more. </p> <p class="style1">This summer camp was developed by the Purdue Department of Computer Science in order to expose middle-school aged youth to the wide spectrum of computer science concepts. Students will learn to use new computer applications, identify the many places computer science is present, and gauge their interest in the field. The camp also identifies the diverse career opportunities available to a computer scientist.</p> <p class="style1">Specific objectives include exposure to careers in computer science, increasing problem-solving skills, building awareness of the importance of math and science in preparing for a career in computer science, and increasing awareness of our K-12 outreach services that are available. </p> <p class="style1">Campers will be housed on Purdue&rsquo;s campus in the air-conditioned Hillenbrand Hall and registration fees cover all meals, &ldquo;fun nights,&rdquo; student admission to the recognition luncheon, and all materials. Activities are led by Mindy Hart, Purdue University Computer Science K-12 Outreach Coordinator and certified teachers.</p> <p class="style1">The Camp runs June 13-18, and will focus on solving real-life problems using computer science. Campers should be comfortable using a computer, but no previous experience is needed in any of the applications.</p> <p class="style1">Registration for the Computer Science Summer Camp is open. Space is limited, and parents who register their child before June 1 will receive a discount. Parents may go online and visit <em><a href="http://www.conf.purdue.edu/cscamp" target="_blank">www.conf.purdue.edu/cscamp</a> </em>to register their rising 6th, 7th, or 8th grader for the camp.
