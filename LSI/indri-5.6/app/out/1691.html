This course introduces students to the process and main techniques in data mining, including classification, clustering, and pattern mining approaches. Data mining systems and applications will also be covered, along with selected topics in current research. </p> <h3>Prerequisites</h3> <p> STAT516 or an equivalent introductory statistics course, CS 381 or an equivalent course that covers basic programming skills (e.g., STAT 598G), or permission of instructor. <h3>Text</h3> <p> D.
