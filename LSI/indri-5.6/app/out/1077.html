Format refers to the data contained in the audit trails as well as their structure. Most computer systems support some form of audit trail, but it seldom contains enough useful information in the right format to be useful to intrusion and misuse detection systems. The purpose of this project is to develop a sound foundation for future system designers to use. <P> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> </body> </html> </html>
