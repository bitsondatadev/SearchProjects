His research interests span the areas of scientific computing, parallel algorithms, applications, and architectures. His recent work has been in the areas of dense hierarchical solvers and preconditioners for boundary element methods and particle dynamics. These find applications in electromagnetic scattering, circuit simulations, vorticity methods for fluid flows, and n-body applications in astrophysics and molecular dynamics. Professor Grama's work on parallelization of these methods has resulted in highly efficient and scalable parallel formulations. Problems that could not even be generated, let alone solved, until very recently can be solved within minutes using hierarchical approximations and massively parallel processors. His other research interests in the area of scientific computation include parallel preconditioners for sparse linear systems. <P> Professor Grama's current research interests span parallel algorithms and applications, and architectures for parallel processing. In addition to articles on these topics, he has co-authored a text <i>Introduction to Parallel Computing</i>, Benjamin Cummings/Addison Wesley, 1994. His recent work has been on the application of approximate methods in particle dynamics to the solution of boundary integral problems. Professor Grama is a member of Sigma Xi. <P> Professor Grama also has significant interest in parallel algorithms in which he has co-authored a text, and papers on performance metrics, and architecture independent models for parallel computation. <P> Projects: <UL> <li> <A HREF="/research/hspbem.html"> Hierarchical Solvers and Preconditioners for Boundary Element Methods <li> <A HREF="/research/mpupa.html"> Models for Parallel and Uni-Processor Architectures </UL> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/ayg"> Grama's homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
