Vishwanathan, and Olga Vitek on their recent promotions!<br /> <br /> <img src="../people/images/faculty/fahmy.jpg" width="117" height="175" border="10" align="left" />Sonia Fahmy was promoted to full Professor with tenure. Fahmy joined the Department in 1999. She earned her PhD degree in Computer and Information Science at the Ohio State University. Fahmy's research interests lie in the design and evaluation of network architectures and protocols. She has made several important research contributions in the areas of network simulation and testbeds, wireless sensor networks, Internet measurement, and congestion control. Fahmy serves on the editorial boards of IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking and IEEE Transactions on Computers. She has served on the organizing and technical program committees of several conferences including IEEE INFOCOM, ICNP, and ICDCS.
