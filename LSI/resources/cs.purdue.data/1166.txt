Hong Chen, Emil Stefanov, and Ferry Unardi will compete in the ICPC East Central North America Regional Programming Contest Saturday, November 5. Hong Chen is a fourth semester graduate student and was a finalist in the Algorithm Coding Competition at the 2005 TopCoder Collegiate Challenge. Ferry Unardi, ACM Program Director, and Emil Stefanov are sophomores in the CS program.</p> <p>The Purdue Programming Team is coached by Tomek Czajka, 2003 and 2004 TopCoder champ. Tomek opened the programming challenge to anyone interested in joining with plans to advance the best competitors. Contestants competed locally in the selection contest on September 27. From this the top three coders were selected to compete in the ICPC East Central North America Regional Programming Contest.</p> <p> The 2005 ICPC East Central North America Regional Programming Contest is sponsored by IBM. This event gathers students from colleges and universities throughout western Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, eastern Ontario, and Indiana (excluding the Greater Chicago Metropolitan Area). Winners selected from the ECNA RPC will advance to the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ACM ICPC) World Finals in San Antonio, Texas, April 9-13, 2006. Prizes, scholarships, and bragging rights are at stake for some of the world's finest university students of the computing sciences and engineering. </p> <p>Good Luck to the Purdue Programming Team! </p> <p> <STRONG><BR> </STRONG></p> </div> </div> <div align="center"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"><div align="center"><img src="images/05coder-2.JPG" width="400" height="284" align="middle"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="2"><p align="center" class="style1">The Purdue Programming Team practices for Saturday's competition. </p> </td> </tr> </table> </body> </html> </html>
