Darmstadt. During the Summer of 1985, he was a visiting professor at the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, New York and in the Summer of 1993 he was a visiting scientist at the Scalable Systems Division of Intel. His research interests cover real-time systems, computer networks, performance evaluation of computer and communication systems, parallel and distributed systems, and scientific computing.<P> Dr. Marinescu was the chief architect of a real-time data acquisition and analysis system used in experiments leading to the discovery of the superheavy elements; meitnerium, hessium, and nielsbohrium. He is currently leading a project in computational biology processed on the development of parallel algorithms and methods for the 3-D atomic structure deterioration of large macromolecules like viruses. He is also involved in the Scalable I/O Initiative. <P> <i>Projects:</i> <UL> <li> <A HREF="../research/bond.html">Bond</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/emma.html">EMMA </A> <li> <A HREF="../research/dps.html">Data Processing Suite </A> <li> <A HREF="../research/padicomp.html">Parallel and Distributed Computing for Solving Very Large Structural Biology Problems</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/pagingio.html">The Study of the Paging and I/O Activity of Parallel Programs</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/tonitza.html">The Tonitza Project </A> </ul> <P> <A HREF="../publications/dcm.html">Recent Publications</a> <P> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/dcm"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
