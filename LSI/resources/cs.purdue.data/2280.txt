Any infractions of this code will be dealt with STRICTLY in accordance with the established rules of Purdue University. </p> <ul> <li> ALL work in this class is individual, unless prior permission has been explicitly granted by the instructor. Any evidence of copying or cooperation will be considered academic dishonesty. <br> <br> <li> It is the students' responsibility to adequately protect their work on the computer. If you need assistance protecting your work, please contact your TA or instructor. It is a good idea to read-protect all your work and not share your password with anyone. <br> <br> <li> In cases of academic dishonesty, all parties will be considered equally responsible, even if one admits to copying from the other. <br> <br> <li> Please realize that in case you copy a homework, the penalty must be more than a zero grade for that particular homework. (If this were not the case, one would have nothing to lose by simply copying a homework that he/she had not done in the first place). <br> <br> </ul> </font> </BODY></HTML> </BODY></HTML>
