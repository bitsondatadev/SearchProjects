Participation in this fellowship program, sponsored by the U. S. Department of Education and Purdue University, includes a strong component of supervised teaching experience, designed to prepare the fellow to be an effective university educator. To be eligible for this fellowship, an applicant must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, have an expressed interest in pursuing the Ph.D. degree and ultimately a career in academics, and have a demonstrated financial need. The financial support offered through this program remains in place for up to five years. Women and underrepresented minority students are particularly encouraged to apply for this program. The department of Chemistry received 8 fellowships, Computer Sciences 7, and Mathematics and Environmental Sciences, 6.<p><br> <p align="center"><font size="+1"><b>Fellowship Initiative in the Development of the Next-Generation Computing Infrastructure</b></font></p> The CS fellowships are administered by Greg Frederickson.<p> The objective of the fellowships is to train highly qualified Ph.D. students in the design and development of the next generation of computing technologies and computing environments. These students will engage in research in four areas identified for future growth in the departmental strategic plan. These areas are computational biology and nanotechnology, information security, massive data handling, and pervasive computing. These areas build on the department's current strength, are interdisciplinary in nature, and hold the promise for major discoveries and advancement benefiting all of science. <p> The fellowships allow us to attract high-quality U.S. students who would otherwise not come to Purdue. Their presence in the graduate program improves the general quality of our graduate students, the quality of our research programs, as well as our ability to attract additional U.S. graduate students. The instructional training of the fellows have a positive impact on our graduate program and raise the awareness of graduate education among our undergraduates.<p> </FONT> </TD></TR> </TABLE> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
