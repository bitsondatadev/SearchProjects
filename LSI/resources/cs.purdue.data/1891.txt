This future computational power and communication infrastructure will allow <EM>computing everywhere</EM>. Learning and training simulators will be part of any classroom and laboratory. The concept of classroom, laboratory, and individual workplace will change; they will become virtual places based on an array of multimedia devices. We are developing and implementing the software architecture of such an environment, referred to as <EM>SciencePad</EM>. It seeks to provide a powerful and ubiquitous tool to aid scientists in their tasks. This project will use existing classrooms and laboratories currently part of the Computational Science and Engineering (CS&amp;E) program. We propose to address related research issues on <EM>intelligent</EM> computing, <EM>intelligent</EM> interfaces, <EM>intelligent</EM> communication,<A NAME=MARKER-10-87></A> integration of computing systems (i.e., symbolic, numeric, geometric and office) on mobile platforms, and to study the integration of tools to support telematics (e.g., telelearning, teleworking, information/data gathering, teleoperations).<P> <EM>SciencePad</EM> can be thought of as a platform that provides generic problem solving capabilities for scientific computing in a ubiquitous environment. Specifically, in this project we integrate access to existing problem solving environments (e.g. PDELab, Mathematica, Matlab), existing information access systems (e.g. WWW, digital libraries), multimedia functionality as well as data acquisition, visualization and analysis tools through <EM>SciencePad</EM>. The <EM>SciencePad</EM> PSE<A NAME=MARKER-10-88></A> is being implemented in a physical classroom/laboratory on a hardware system that contains multimedia devices, wireless networks, notebook computers, high performance computing servers and electronic liveboards. Its efficacy will be evaluated in several courses, including those from the CS Department and the CS&amp;E program. <P> Information regarding this project is available at <EM><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse/scipad/scipad.html">http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse/scipad/scipad.html</A> </EM>and <EM><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse/softlab/softlab.html">http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse/softlab/softlab.html</A>.</EM><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <ADDRESS>CS Annual Report - 19 APR 1996</ADDRESS> <A HREF="AR95Book-102.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bnext.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-100.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bprev.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-66.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bup.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Btop.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bcontent.gif"></A><BR><A HREF="AR95Book-102.html">[Next] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-100.html">[Previous] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-66.html">[Up] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html">[Top] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html">[Contents]</A> <P> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
