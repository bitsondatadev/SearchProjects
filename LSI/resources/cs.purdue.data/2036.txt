But rapper Armand Navabi (MC Plus+) and DJ Barry Wittman (Lord Illingworth) are busting rhymes that any coder can appreciate. Lord Illingworth's PhD advisor, Prof. Greg Frederickson says, &quot;It's been a bit of a shock, that my mild-mannered graduate student has been leading this double life. Now I'm half-wondering which persona will show up for his Prelim next week.&quot;</p> <p class="style1">MC Plus+ and Lord Illingworth are popular in their home department, Purdue Computer Science. The twosome's beats are inspired by the everyday experiences of a computer programmer. This has made them a favorite act at events such as the CS Employee Appreciation Social event (pictured). Music lovers can download tracks from their newest album <em>Chip Hop</em> at the <a href="http://www.mcplusplus.com/" target="_blank">MC Plus+ web site.</a></p> <p class="style1">In support of the MC Plus+ second album <em>Chip Hop</em>, the MC Plus+ and Lord Illingworth duo will perform at Downtown Records on Saturday, February 17. The performance starts at 7:00 p.m. at 210 N. Sixth Street , Lafayette (Downtown Records).
