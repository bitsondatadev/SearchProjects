The facilities are operated by a technical staff who are not only responsible for the installation and maintenance of the systems, but who also assist faculty and students in the development of software systems for research projects. The staff includes a director, facilities manager, administrative assistant, secretary, two hardware engineers, and seven staff system administrators. <P> <CENTER> <TABLE> <TR> <TD ALIGN=MIDDLE><FONT COLOR="#CE9C33"> <H3>General Facilities</H3> </TD> </TR> </TABLE> </CENTER> General computing facilities are available for both administrative activities (such as the preparation of research reports and technical publications) and research needs that are not supported by other dedicated equipment. These facilities include four Sun multiprocessor systems and several Sun and Windows NT file servers. The main systems each have 128 to 256 MB of main memory and a total of over 300 GB of disk storage. All faculty and many graduate students have a Sun, Silicon Graphics, Pentium II, or X display station on their desk. <P> <CENTER> <IMG SRC="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/ar98/images/facilitiesChartColor.gif"> </CENTER> <P> <CENTER> <TABLE> <TR> <TD ALIGN=MIDDLE><FONT COLOR="#CE9C33"> <H3>Educational Facilities</H3> </TD> </TR> </TABLE> </CENTER> Computing systems used by students enrolled in both undergraduate and graduate computer science courses include over 80 Intel Pentium-based PCs running either Sun Solaris or Windows NT. Three rooms in the Computer Science Building are dedicated to laboratory-based instruction using these facilities. A later section (Purdue University Computing Center Facilities) lists equipment owned and maintained by the Computing Center but used by computer science students. <P> <CENTER> <TABLE> <TR> <TD ALIGN=MIDDLE><FONT COLOR="#CE9C33"> <H3>I/O Equipment</H3> </TD> </TR> </TABLE> </CENTER> The department operates both special-purpose output devices as well as general output equipment, including about 60 laser printers, color printers, color scanners, and video projectors. <P> <CENTER> <TABLE> <TR> <TD ALIGN=MIDDLE><FONT COLOR="#CE9C33"> <H3>Networking Services</H3> </TD> </TR> </TABLE> </CENTER> The department is strongly committed to state-of-the-art networking technology to provide access to and communication among its systems, as well as to those elsewhere on campus and throughout the world. Twenty-eight Ethernets in the Computer Science Building connect the workstations and network terminal concentrators to the departmental computing facilities. An ATM fabric currently supports 45 workstations, and a fiber-optic ATM link connects departmental systems to other systems on campus, as well as to the Internet community. ISDN and ADSL connections are in use for remote access from a number of nearby sites. <P> <CENTER> <TABLE> <TR> <TD ALIGN=MIDDLE><FONT COLOR="#CE9C33"> <H3>Purdue University Computing Center Facilities</H3> </TD> </TR> </TABLE> </CENTER> In addition to the facilities described above, students and faculty have access to computing systems owned and operated by the Purdue University Computing Center (PUCC). General instructional facilities operated by PUCC include a large Sun SPARCserver, an IBM 3090, and several Sun, Mac, and Windows laboratories. In addition, PUCC provides systems for use in courses taught by the CS Department. These systems include Sun SPARC 5 workstations for undergraduate computer science courses and IBM-compatible personal computers for use in an introductory course for non-majors (CS 110). Departmental research projects make use of other facilities provided by PUCC, including an Intel Paragon and IBM SP/2. <P> <FONT COLOR="#ce9c33" SIZE="-1"> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/ar98"> <CENTER> 1998 <BR> Annual Research Report</A> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu" TARGET="_top">Department of <BR> Computer Sciences</A> </CENTER> </FONT> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
