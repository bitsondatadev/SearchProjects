This application conferencing substrate facilitates user level cooperation and supports many modes of asynchronous and synchronous multiple-user interaction. We hope to demonstrate how the communication and collaboration facilities of this substrate helps us to build shared workspaces with multimedia interfaces, and how they can be used to design sophisticated collaborative problem solving environments.<P> We are currently building three example scenarios:<P> <UL> <LI> air/land/sea defense <LI> human body walk through <LI> underwater world </UL> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
