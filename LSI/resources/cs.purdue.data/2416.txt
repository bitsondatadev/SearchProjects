It is also critical to understand the impact of multicore architecture on designs of computer applications, computing algorithms, and software. <br><br> CS490M, a seminar course for upper level undergraduate students, will begin by an introduction to the fundamental concepts of multicore architectures, including <ul> <li> <strong> parallel tasks </strong>, <li> <strong> data dependences </strong>, <li> <strong> memory bandwidth </strong>, <li> <strong> data locality </strong>, <li> <strong> processor synchronization </strong>, etc. </ul> The newest multicore microprocessors will be used as examples to illustrate these concepts. The course will then proceed to study current <strong> programming models </strong> and <strong> performance evaluation tools </strong> which which target multicore architectures. <br><br> To give students some hands-on experience, we will let them examine a few <strong> multimedia applications </strong>, e.g. MPEG software and sound recording/editing software, as test programs and explore potential ways to enhance the performance of such software by utilizing efficient parallel tasks. This effort will be conducted in groups. <br><br> Towards the second half of the semester, the course will become increasingly more interactive, with increased participation from the students as investigators and reviewers of the state of the art (i.e. reading and presenting recent research results on related subjects), as well as investigators of real systems and software reporting their experience from the experiments with the multimedia software. <br><br> We will use the multicore machines donated by the Intel for the group projects. <h3> Pre-requisite </h3> CS250 <h3><font color="#0000ff"> Grading of CS490M </font> </h3> Students are encouraged to open their mind and focus on learning and experimenting with new ideas. Hence the grading for the course will roughly following this scheme: <ul> <li> Participation in class discussions (65%) </li> <li> Group project (20%) </li> <li> Paper presentation (15%) </li> </ul> <hr> </body> </html> </html>
