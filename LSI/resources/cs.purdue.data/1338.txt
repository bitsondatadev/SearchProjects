Examples of applications requiring multicast support include audio and video conferencing applications, video on demand, distance learning, tele-metering, distributed games, server and replicated database synchronization, advertising, searching and data distribution applications. The applications exhibit large variation in group sizes, bandwidth requirements, and group dynamics. <p> In this talk, I will discuss approaches to multicast congestion control in the Internet. These approaches are targeted towards applications not requiring strict delay guarantees, which may or may not be loss tolerant. Multicasting introduces many challenges to the congestion control problem. The key problems include scalability, heterogeneity, and group join and leave dynamics. In addition, new problems such as feedback implosion and drop to zero arise. The algorithms should be interoparable with both hierarchical/proxy ACK-based reliable multicast protocols such as the Reliable Multicast Transport Protocol II (RMTP-II), and with NAK-based protocols such as Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) and Cisco's Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM). <p> <hr> <p> <em> The <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/nsl/colloquium.html"> Network Systems Colloquium</a> is sponsored by the <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/nsl">Network Systems Lab</a> at <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/"> Purdue University</a>.
