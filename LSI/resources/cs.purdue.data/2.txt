The program takes place from June 4, 2012 through July 13, 2012 and includes laboratory/industry visits, cultural activities, and interactions with French science students.</p> <p class="style1">The program involves taking one 30- to 60-hour STEM-related course (choices include Introduction to Physcial Computing and Probability Modeling) and one 36-hour French language course. Geared toward English-speaking students, fluency in French is not required (though some introductory coursework in high school would not hurt).</p> <p class="style1">The first session in June 2012 is tuition-free.</p> <p class="style1">To learn more about this summer program opportunity, please view <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/news/Bachelor-Summer-Program-Jan2012.pdf">this PDF file</a>.
