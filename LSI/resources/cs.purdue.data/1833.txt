We are developing programs that construct detailed joint models from clinical data, compute their physics (motions, forces, stresses) in activities of daily living, and display the results via interactive graphics. The primary purpose of the research is to support clinical applications, such as prosthesis design and repetitive strain injury modeling. The secondary purpose is to improve medical education by providing teachers and students with detailed, interactive models of the musculoskeletal system in sickness and in health. Beyond joint modeling, the research is advancing the state of the art in shape reconstruction and visualization of the human body, including the skull, the brain, and the spine.<P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <ADDRESS>CS Annual Report - 19 APR 1996</ADDRESS> <A HREF="AR95Book-126.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bnext.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-124.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bprev.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-66.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bup.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Btop.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bcontent.gif"></A><BR><A HREF="AR95Book-126.html">[Next] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-124.html">[Previous] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-66.html">[Up] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html">[Top] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html">[Contents]</A> <P> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
