<TITLE> Message from the Department Head</TITLE> </HEAD> <BODY> <A NAME=HEADING3></A> <IMG SRC="sameh1-med.gif"><IMG SRC="deptHeadRjT.gif"> <BR> <B>Ahmed Sameh</B><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <P> I am pleased to begin 1997 as the fifth department Head of Computer Sciences at Purdue University. My predecessors have built a solid foundation upon which we continue to build. In particular, on behalf of the faculty, staff, and students, I would like to thank Professor John Rice for his innovative and able leadership of the Department over the past thirteen years.<P> Computer science is a field that continues to evolve at a rate faster than other disciplines. Advances in the field have resulted in significant developments in computer and software technology, which in turn, have had a tremendous impact on the way research is conducted in other science and engineering disciplines. This revolution has also affected the way we teach in the classroom and is continuously refining the concept of "distance learning."<P> This department continues to contribute to advances in Computer Science and is striving to improve its stature as one of the leading computer science departments in the nation. We instill in our students values, vision and training that will prepare them for a lifetime of continued learning and leadership in the field. Besides nourishing basic research in the core areas of Computer Science, we are also pursuing opportunities to be involved in interdisciplinary research activities so as to strengthen and broaden our field. In addition to addressing improvements in our undergraduate and graduate curriculum, we are determined to build strong alliances with computer, software, and related industries, both in the state of Indiana and throughout the nation. <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <ADDRESS>CS Annual Report 15 JAN 1997</ADDRESS> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
