Access control is one of the few sub-areas within information security that have been studied for quite long time and have some relatively-well-established theory.-->The goals of this course are the following.&nbsp;&nbsp; <ul> <li> <p style="margin-bottom: 12">Give students a systematic and in depth understanding of access control theory and techniques.&nbsp; The focus of this course is not on giving a listing of the various models and techniques developed for access control, but rather on understanding the effectiveness and limitation of these models and techniques.&nbsp; While examining research results, we ask the following questions: What are the problems this piece of work tries to solve?&nbsp; To what extent does it solve the problems?&nbsp; Are these the right problems to solve?&nbsp; How could this result be used in practice?&nbsp; What other problems can be asked?&nbsp; While examining existing systems, we ask similar questions about the access control features in these systems.&nbsp;</li> <li> <p style="margin-bottom: 12">Give students (especially beginning graduate students) some exposure to research activities such as literature research, independent thinking and analysis, interacting with the instructor and peer students, and organizing and presenting materials and results.</li> <li> <p style="margin-bottom: 12">Help interested students develop long term research interests in this area.</li> </ul> </font> <FONT size=+1 color="#000099"> <FONT size=+1 color="#000099"> <FONT size=+1 color="#000099"> <FONT size=+1 color="#000099"> <p><b> Prerequisites: </b> </font> </font> </font> </font> <FONT color="#000099"> <ul> <li>Information security: minimum one (graduate or undergraduate) course on security/cryptography required, e.g., any of CS426, CS555, CS526.</li> <li>Theory of computation and algorithms: CS381 or equivalent and <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/courses/catalog/2003/Spring/cs483.shtml">CS483</a> or equivalent.&nbsp; </li> <li>Database systems: an undergraduate database course (e.g. <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/courses/catalog/2003/Spring/cs448.shtml">CS448</a> or equivalent) highly recommended.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please <a href="mailto:ninghui.li@cs.stanford.edu">contact the instructor</a> if there is any question about prerequisites.&nbsp; <p><b>Relationship with CS 526</b></p> <ul> <li>This course do not require CS 526 as a prerequisite.&nbsp; As a result, about 10% of the contents in this course overlap with that in CS 526.&nbsp; </li> </ul> </font> </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE> <HR> </BODY></HTML>
