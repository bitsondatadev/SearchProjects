The problems under consideration are too large for the traditional QR-type schemes, or solvers that use expanding subspaces. The algorithm currently under development is based on the trace minimization algorithm (previous work of the PI) which, with a good sfifting strategy, converges at least as fast as other well-known methods such as Lanczos method and Jacobi-Davidson method, but uses far less storage than needed by these methods, and which is more suitable for parallel architectures. The major challenge in this research is to design an efficient and robust shifting strategy that overcomes problems associated with closely spaced eigenvalues or clusters of eigenvalues. <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
