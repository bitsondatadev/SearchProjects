Of special interest are optimality, stability, and efficiency issues in congestion control, routing, and quality of service (QoS) provision. Dr. Park has also done work on the application side with emphasis on the facilitation of transparent distributed computing environments. He is also interested in fault-tolerance issues in distributed computing where the goal is to design local algorithms for regular, many-body structures (e.g., cellular automata) that collectively exhibit self-healing properties under various faults. <P> <i>Projects:</i> <UL> <li> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/ccssnt.html"> Congestion Control for Self-Similar Network Traffic <li> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/QoS.html"> Competitive Dynamics of QoS Provision in High-Speed Networks <li> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/ftclsds.html"> Fault-Tolerant Computing in Large-Scale Distributed Systems </UL> <P> <A HREF="../publications/park.html">Recent Publications</a> <P> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/park"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
