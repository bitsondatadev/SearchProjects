This year's program offers practical solutions to cyber security problems. To find out more visit <a href="http://www.acsac.org" target="_blank">http://www.acsac.org</a>.<br> <br> There is a new and exciting format this year. On Monday, December 5 there will be a special workshop on Malicious Software (Prevention and Defense) plus tutorials on application security training, Common Criteria version 3, trust management, and defense against malicious software.<br> <br> The length of the technical program has been extended to three full days to bring new momentum into the conference. To accommodate the record number of high-quality submissions received, two more sessions for peer-reviewed technical papers has been added, and the technical track review-process was revised to ensure that technical papers with high practical impact are accepted. This year there are more choices to attendees, while keeping tried and true features such as plenary talks, classic papers, works in progress, and panels.<br> <br> Tuesday-Thursday, December 6-8, there will be forty-five peer reviewed papers on practical computer security; presentations of security case studies; a new type of session, called 'technology blitz' is designed to offer rapid-fire introductions to emerging and mature security technologies and their applications; classic papers on the foundations of computer security, including David Bell reprising his Bell-LaPadula model; works in progress -- quick updates on ongoing projects; and Distinguished Practitioner Brian Snow and Invited Essayist Mary Ellen Zurko. On Friday, December 9 we have tutorials on analysis of large scale network data, security policy modeling, securing web service applications, and mobile security issues.<br> <br> The location of the ACSAC web site has changed, and the postal and email lists need to be rebuilt. Please go to <a href="http://www.acsac.org/list/" target="_blank">http://www.acsac.org/list/</a> even if you have signed up previous, so that you can receive up-to-date information. Because ACSAC is rebuilding the lists, for a short while, you may receive more than one message about ACSAC. (They apologize for the inconvenience.)<br> <br> ACSAC is sponsored by Applied Computer Security Associates, a not- for-profit, all-volunteer Maryland corporation. The postal address is 2906 Covington Road, Silver Spring, MD 20910-1206.
