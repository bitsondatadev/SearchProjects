One goal is to study and review the existing literature on software testing, which describes a wide range of techniques including mutation testing, slicing, test case coverage determination, etc. Many of the software testing techniques are very expensive and time consuming. Therefore, one objective is to establish which existing testing techniques are most effective for vulnerability detection, in order to provide software engineers guidelines for the selection of testing methods. Another objective is to investigate the existing security vulnerabilities and earlier work on classification of software faults to find or design a suitable classification scheme. <P> <FONT COLOR="#ce9c33" SIZE="-1"> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/ar98" TARGET="_top"> <CENTER> 1998 <BR> Annual Research Report</A> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu" TARGET="_top">Department of <BR> Computer Sciences</A> </CENTER> </FONT> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
