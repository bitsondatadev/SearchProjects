She has experience in ERP system implementation, network OSS development, IT infrastructure implementation, and custom application development. She graduated from Purdue in 1981, with a bachelors in Computer Science, then completed her Masters in Business at the University of Illinois in 1983. She is married to Malcolm Railey, BSEE, MSEE, whom she shamelessly leveraged to help her with her EE circuit logic class as well as &lsquo;borrowing&rsquo; his EE graduate student computer access to the CS systems to do her programs vs. having to wait in line for terminals at the Math/Science building. They married a week after graduation in 1981 at St. Thomas Aquinas &ndash; a real Purdue couple. They have three children: Kristen, a sophomore at MIT; Stuart, a high school junior; and Owen, an 8th grader. They live in Summit, New Jersey, and are active Puppy Raisers for the Seeing Eye.<br /> </p> <p><strong>David Spellmeyer</strong><br /> David Spellmeyer is currently Chief Technology Officer and Chief Informatics Officer of Nodality, a startup biotechnology company headquartered in South San Francisco, CA.
