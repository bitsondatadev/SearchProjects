Mathur</A> <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <P> As the importance of multimedia grows, we envisage increasing use of sound as an output medium. Examples of use of sound are virtual reality systems, simulations, video games, education for the visually-handicapped computer users and data analysis systems. In most of these applications sound is emitted during the execution of an application when an event occurs or during an activity. Addition of sound to such an application requires (a) identification of points in the code that are centers of such events or activities and (b) adding suitable code responsible for emitting sound. The effectiveness of sound as a medium in an application depends, amongst other factors, on how well (a) and (b) are performed. <P> The Listen system has been designed to help in performing these tasks in a friendly environment on a PC or a workstation. The current version of Listen can be used for auralizing C programs on Sun workstations. We used Listen to conduct experiments in understanding program behavior, testing and debugging, classroom teaching, and development of software for the blind. <P> For more information see: <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/apm/listen/listen.html"> http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/apm/listen/listen.html</a> <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
