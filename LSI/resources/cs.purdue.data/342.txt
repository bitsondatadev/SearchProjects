It contains work areas with 20 Intel Pentium PCs. The Intel Pentium workstations run the Solaris operating system and provide a conventional computing environment. A SPARC file server dedicated to the lab provides an additional 2 GB of disk storage. <p> There are also 35 "back-end" Intel Pentium PCs in the lab reserved for running the Xinu operating system. These machines are controlled by a distributed access/downloader system that allows anyone logged in at any machine to request back-end resources and download programs into them for debugging and testing. <p> Several Intel Pentium Workstations and Sun SPARCstations are dedicated to the Xinu project providing additional support for experimentation with heterogeneous machines and disk space for remote file systems and paging. All machines in the Xinu lab connect to an Ethernet that is connected through a gateway to the Internet backbone. Thus, the machines have connectivity to other universities and research labs throughout the country. <P> <FONT COLOR="#ce9c33" SIZE="-1"> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/ar98" TARGET="_top"> <CENTER> 1998 <BR> Annual Research Report</A> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu" TARGET="_top">Department of <BR> Computer Sciences</A> </CENTER> </FONT> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
