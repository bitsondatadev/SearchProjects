She is also involved in applications dealing with CAD, in particular algorithms for geometric constraint decomposition and manipulation which have a combined geometric and graph-theoretic flavor. <P> <i>Projects:</i> <ul> <li> <a href="../research/qos.html"> QoS Provision in Noncooperative Network Environments</a> <li> <a href="../research/gc.html"> Geometric Constraint Decomposition and Manipulation</a> <li> <a href="../research/lb.html"> Complexity Lower Bounds</a> <li> <a href="../research/approx.html"> Approximation From Linear Spaces and Its Application to Complexity</a> <li> <a href="../research/algeb.html"> Properties of Algebraic Systems</a> </ul> <P> <A HREF="../publications/sitharam.html">Recent Publications</a> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/sitharam"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
