Additional equipment and material have been added through subsequent NSF grants, contributions from the Department of Computer Sciences, and enhancement grants from <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/serc" TARGET="_top">SERC</a> affiliates. The lab provides a multi-system base of resources to support the research activities of the faculty and students working in the SERC. Resources in the lab and SERC offices include several Pentium-based high end PC's. All the facilities in SERC lab are connected to a local Ethernet configured as a subnet of the departmental network. <P> <FONT COLOR="#ce9c33" SIZE="-1"> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/ar98" TARGET="_top"> <CENTER> 1998 <BR> Annual Research Report</A> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu" TARGET="_top">Department of <BR> Computer Sciences</A> </CENTER> </FONT> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
