Yau <P> Research Assistants: S. Wang, S. Li <P> We are investigating and designing an active network architecture that is efficient, extensible, secure, and provides quality of service (QoS) support for applications. The main thrust of our research is in two directions. First, we aim to develop an infrastructure for experimenting with active networks. This infrastructure includes an active network engine (ANE) at each active node, a dispatcher facility for launching capsule programs, and transport services between active nodes. The ANE includes an integrated CPU scheduler for executing capsule programs with diverse QoS guarantees. Second, we are conducting experiments to evaluate the impact of several active networking techniques on multimedia and collaborative applications. We conduct experiments to determine the feasibility, generality, flexibility and efficiency of the active networks. We plan to experimentally evaluate the ARC scheduling framework in supporting capsule program execution with QoS guarantee. We investigate the site congestion behavior and its neighboring effects. Our experimental results will help quantify the cost and benefits of active networking, vis-a-vis a traditional networking architecture. <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <P> <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
