He is especially interested in techniques for making retargetable tools. He is the primary creator of the New Jersey Machine-Code Toolkit, which helps generate the machine-dependent code used in such applications. The toolkit uses a compact machine-description language that relates symbolic and binary representations of instructions. Specifications for the MIPS R300, SPARC, Intel Pentium, and PowerPC 604 range in size from 130 to 500 lines. From a specification, the toolkit derives the machine-dependent logic used in assembly, linking, analysis, etc. The toolkit's specification language also provides a high-level notation which can be used to recognize instructions, e.g., for object-code instrumentation or analysis.<P> Professor Ramsey is also interested in literate programming - the art of presenting programs primarly as documents to be read by people, and only secondarily to be executed by machine. He created the Spiderweb tool for building language-dependent literate-programming tools, as well as noweb, the first and most widely used language-independent literate-programming tool.<P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/nr"> Ramsey's home page </A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <ADDRESS>CS Annual Report - 19 APR 1996</ADDRESS> <A HREF="AR95Book-36.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bnext.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-34.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bprev.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-6.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bup.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Btop.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bcontent.gif"></A><BR><A HREF="AR95Book-36.html">[Next] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-34.html">[Previous] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-6.html">[Up] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html">[Top] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html">[Contents]</A> <P> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
