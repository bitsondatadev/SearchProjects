His research interests include problem solving environments, computational finance, parallel/neural/mobile computing, performance evaluation and modeling, expert systems for scientific computing, numerical analysis, and distributed learning. He is the co-editor of several proceedings in the areas of "supercomputing" and "expert systems for scientific computing," a member IFIP working group 2.5 in numerical software and on the editorial board of <i>Neural, Parallel and Scientific Computations</i> and <i>HPC Users Journals</i>. He served as acting head of the Department of Computer Sciences at Purdue during the 1987-88 and 1993-94 academic years, and as associate head for several years. <p> <i>Labs:</i> <ul> <li> <A HREF="../facilities/labs/cse.html">CS&E Lab</A> </ul> <P> <i>Projects:</i> <UL> <LI> <A HREF="../research/neuralcomp.html">Neural Computing</A> <LI> <A HREF="../research/softlab.html">SoftLab--A Laboratory for Computational Science</A> <LI> Distributing Computations in Multiprocessor Systems <LI> <A HREF="../research/hpcpde.html">High-Performance Computing (HPC) Methods and Systems for Partial Differential Equations (PDE)</A> <LI> <A HREF="../research/pamecosy.html">Parallel Methods and Collaborating Systems for Solving Partial Differential Equations</A> <LI> <A HREF="../research/pdesks.html">PDE Solving Kernels and Systems for Multi-Physics Applications</A> <LI> <A HREF="../research/pdelab.html">PDELab: Problem Solving Environments and Methods for the Development of PDE-Based Applications on Parallel Machines</A> <li> <a href="../research/poems.html"> POEMS - End-to-End Performance Modeling of Large Heterogeneous Adaptive Parallel/Distributed Computer/Communication Systems</a> <LI> <A HREF="../research/pythia.html">PYTHIA: Using Computational Intelligence to Support Problem Solving Environments </A> <LI> <A HREF="../research/sciencepad.html">SciencePad</A> <LI> <A HREF="../research/ellpack.html">ELLPACK System</A> <LI> <A HREF="../research/fina.html">FINANZIA: Computational Methods and Software for Financial Derivatives</A> </UL> <P> <A HREF="../publications/enh.html">Recent Publications</a> <P> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/enh"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
