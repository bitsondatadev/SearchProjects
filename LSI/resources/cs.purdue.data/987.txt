The research focuses on the application area of computer vision and image processing (CVIP). The research is predicated on the philosophy that high performance computing must meet seemingly contradictory goals: software development should be carried out in an architecture- and technology-independent environment, but both algorithms and system software should take full advantage of the hardware features of potentially diverse architectures. These contradictory demands are reconciled by pursuing research in three areas: <UL> <li> The development and validation of a computational model that serves as a platform for architecture-independent algorithm development, gives an accurate prediction of algorithm performance, and supports a realistic scalability metric. <li> The implementation of CVIP task scenarios on diverse architectures, including the Intel Paragon, Cray T3D and T3E, IBM SP-1 and SP-2, and networks of workstations. <li> The development of applications-driven library-based software tools that bridge the software gap between usability and high performance and which provide applications users with high performance codes in a flexible environment. </UL> <p> For a more complete description see <a href="http://ece.www.ecn.purdue.edu/~scalable"> http://ece.www.ecn.purdue.edu/~scalable</a> <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
