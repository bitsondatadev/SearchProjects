This work also contributed basic techniques for dealing with the problem. The work begun at Cornell also included using implicit algebraic surfaces as shape elements in solid modeling for the first time. His monograph <em>Geometric and Solid Modeling: An Introduction</em>, published in 1989, synthesizes the state of the art at that time. An electronic version of the book is available <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/cmh/distribution/books/geo.html">on the web</a> and continues to be used by students and researchers.</p> <p class="style1">In the 1990s, Hoffmann worked on geometric constraint solving and its applications in solid modeling. Collaborating with students and researchers across the globe, the work found numerous applications and became the dominant approach to constraint solving, adopted by systems such as <a href="http://www.3ds.com/products/catia">Dassault’s CATIA</a>. Also in the 1990s, Hoffmann worked out the semantics of feature operations in solid modeling and exposed the crucial importance of the persistent naming problem. Persistent naming is at the heart of platform based engineering and defines the semantics of families of shapes. Both lines of work continue with former students and accomplished researchers.</p> <p class="style1">In the awards lecture at the 2011 conference, Hoffmann sketched a framework for CAD interoperability, addressing a crucial obstacle in discrete manufacturing. The approach features a procedural, query-based paradigm developed in collaboration with <a href="http://www.engr.wisc.edu/me/faculty/shapiro_vadim.html">Vadim Shapiro</a> and <a href="http://www.nist.gov/el/msid/vsrinivasan.cfm">Vijay Srinivasan</a>, two long standing collaborators.</p> <p class="style1">Congratulations to Professor Hoffmann on receiving this recognition!</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table> </div> </body> </html>
