In April, <a href="www.cs.purdue.edu">Purdue Computer Science</a> hosted the Midwest Database Research Symposium and the Midwest Security Workshop. &quot;With a 100-seat meeting room and large, open commons, the Lawson Building is an attractive location for small technical meetings and workshops,&quot; said Purdue Computer Science Assistant Department Head, Dr. Tim Korb. &quot;We are excited to be able to host events like these for our faculty and students.&quot;</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/clifton/MWDBsym/" target="_blank">Fourth Midwest Database Research Symposium</a> was held on Saturday, April 14, 2007. Over 70 computer science scholars gathered for a day of networking. Faculty and students from Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio came to Lawson to discuss their research and share their ideas. Four different poster and demo sessions were held, and judges chose four &quot;Best Posters of 2007.&quot; The judges for the event were Professors Beth Plale (IU), Ruoming Jin (Kent State), Lorenzo Martino (Purdue), and Luo Si (Purdue). Guadalupe Canahuate, Mike Gibas, and Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu of Ohio State won the &quot;Most Novel&quot; awards with their &quot;Update Conscious bitmap Indices&quot; poster. &quot;Best Presented&quot; went to Sandeep Tata, Willis Lang, You Jung Kim, and Jignesh M. Patel of University of Michigan for their &quot;Periscope/SQ:Interactive Data Exploration for Biological sequences&quot; poster. &quot;Most likely for SIGMOD 2008&quot;was awarded to the &quot;General Framework for modeling and processing optimization queries&quot; poster by Michael Gibas, Ning Zheng, and Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu from Ohio State. The poster receiving the &quot;Best Overall&quot; award was &quot;Mining Colossal Frequent Patterns by Core Pattern Fusion,&quot; produced by Feida <strong><font size="-1"><img src="images/4-21-07securework.jpg" width="500" height="329" align="right"></font></strong>Zhu, Xifeng Yan, and Jiawei Han of University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign).</font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 2007 Database Research Symposium was organized by committee co-chairs: Chirs Clifton, Marianne Winslett, Kevin Chang, Alexander Dekhtyar, Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu, <!-- Confirmed --> H.

There were 70 attendants from Purdue, University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign), University of Illinois (Chicago), University of Wisconsin (Madison), De Paul University, Indiana University, livetext.com, and Queensland University of Technology in Australia. This workshop gave students and faculty in the area of security the opportunity to meet other researchers in their area as well as learn of their peers' most recent works. Participants were asked to present research-in-progress or recently published work. There were three presentation sessions broken into different categories of work. The categories were Software Systems Security, Privacy and Information Flow, and Policies. </font></p> <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Midwest Security Workshop organizing committee included <A href="http://www.mnlab.cs.depaul.edu/%7Eehab/">Ehab Al-Shaer</A> of DePaul University, <A href="http://www-faculty.cs.uiuc.edu/%7Ecgunter/">Carl A.
