<title> Corporate Partners’ Program </title> <h1> Corporate Partners’ Program </h1> <p> The Department of Computer Sciences Corporate Partners’ Program has successfully bridged our academic environment with the corporate world. Partner companies have invested in future technologies and human capital. The following companies are members of our program. <p> It is my distinct pleasure to recognize each partner’s on-going commitment to our students and the long-term impact this commitment will have on the quality and quantity of Purdue University graduates, and the overall computer science program. In addition to participating in the Corporate Partners’ Program, the majority of the corporate partner level members are represented on the department’s Corporate Partners’ Council. These representatives attend bi-annual meetings each year. They provide our faculty and administration input on internal affairs and overall program development. The fresh perspective that these representatives have brought to our program is best reflected this year in the changes in our undergraduate curriculum. On behalf of the students, faculty, and staff, thanks to all of our partners for investing in us. <p> Warmest Regards, <p> Andra C.
