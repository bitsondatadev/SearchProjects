This project is referred throughout as <a href="http://pol.cs.purdue.edu"> Purdue-On-Line</a> (POL) and it is currently supported by Purdue University through a reinvestment grant and corporations such as Intel, AT&T and IBM, and the Department of Computer Sciences. The main research goal is to develop and integrate the educational technology with supporting services needed to enable existing courses, to design and deliver "virtual courses" and to meet the growing demand for distance education. Our first target area is freshman education and specifically courses that involve large numbers of students currently taught in a lecture-recitation mode. We are currently designing and delivering a computer-programming course (CS158a) for engineering and science students. The associated material under development is multimodal and customizable for the individual student. We are developing and testing a learning paradigm and environment associated with this course that i) puts the responsibility of student performance to the instructors, ii) improve student performance, iii) decreases the time to learn by at least 30%, iv) makes the course material, produced in consultation with the best instructors in given subject area, available in multimedia form on CD-ROM and Web "anytime" and "everywhere", and v) delivers the course in direct, studio, telepresence, and distance-learning mode. <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> </body> </html> </html>
