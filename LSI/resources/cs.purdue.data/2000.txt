Du, G. Krishnan, M. Kuhn, R. Marynowski <P> Sponsor: COAST Laboratory sponsors (See COAST Laboratory description) <P> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%><p> Commercial software is often deployed with serious flaws in place. This is despite the fact that most of the flaws could be found using any of several well-known testing techniques. Unfortunately, in-depth testing is time-consuming and expensive; as such, few vendors have been willing to employ strong testing methods. The goal of this project is to develop targetted, cost-effective methods of testing software to discover security flaws before the software is deployed. <P> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> </body> </html> </html>
