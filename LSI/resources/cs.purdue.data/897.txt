The Persistent Programming Systems group at Purdue University is participating in this collaboration to investigate optimizations for orthogonal persistence for Java, based on static data-flow analysis of Java bytecodes, dynamic profiling of code execution, and profiling and analysis of the persistent store. <p> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
