Before starting on this assignment, please read the MLC++ manual to see how to use this system. The manual is available in the <a href="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/mlc/">MLC++ web page</a> under documentation. You will first need to make some changes to your shell startup file. In particular, you will need to add the following directories to your search path: <pre><B> /u/u61/cse/MLC++/graphviz/bin /u/u61/cse/MLC++/mlc </b></pre> You will also need to set the environment variable <tt><B>MLCDIR</B></tt> to <tt><B>/u/u61/cse/MLC++</B></tt>. </P> To start playing with MLC++, look in the directory <tt><B>/u/u61/cse/MLC++/mlc</B></tt>. It contains two sample test files from the manual - called <tt><B>tester1</B></tt> and <tt><B>tester2</b></tt>. Do not work in these directories but copy these files over to your home directory and execute them from there. For example, running <tt><B>tester1</B></tt> will cause the following output on your screen and also provide a visualization of the tree induced by ID3. <pre><B> > tester1 Classifying (% done): 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% done.

These are available in <tt><B>/u/u61/cse/MLC++/graphviz/bin</B></tt> which you have already added to your path previously. Documentation for both MLC++ and the <tt><B>dot, dotty</B></tt> utilities is available in the respective directories.
