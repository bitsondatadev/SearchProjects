<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE>Grama</TITLE> </HEAD> <BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"> <P> Professor Grama's research interests span the areas of parallel and distributed computing architectures, algorithms, and applications. His work on distributed infrastructure deals with development of software support for dynamic clustered and multiclustered environments. Models for platform abstractions and performance modeling are also being developed. His research on applications has focused on particle dynamics methods, their applications to dense linear system solvers, and preconditioning sparse systems. More recently, he has also been working on fast algorithms for data compression and analysis. <p> Professor Grama has authored several papers and co-authored a text book <i>Introduction to Parallel Computing: Design and Analysis of Algorithms</i> with Vipin Kumar, Anshul Gupta, and George Karypis. Another book is forthcoming entitled <i>Principles of Parallel Programming</i> co-authored with Vipin Kumar and George Karypis. </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
