Laboratory equipment includes computers donated by Sun Microsystems and IBM, and on loan from the US Air Force. Resources in the lab include over two dozen UltraSparc and SPARC-based Sun workstations, six Apple computers and clones. These systems have over 11 GB of disk storage, much of it devoted to the on-line archives available at <BR> <A HREF="ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub">ftp://coast.cs.purdue.edu/pub</A>. and <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/coast">http://www.cs.purdue.edu/coast</A> <P> In addition to the computers, the lab has its own high-speed laser printers, a color laser printer, and a dedicated router for its own networks. Odds and ends include several tape and CD-ROM drives, a dedicated encryption engine, flatbed scanners, and several removable disk drives. All of this equipment is available to students and faculty for experiments as well as daily use. <P> The COAST Laboratory also has an extensive library of security-related reference materials, proceedings and journals. The collection includes a variety of software tools and packages for the various systems in the lab. <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%><P> <ADDRESS>CS Annual Report - 19 APR 1996</ADDRESS> <A HREF="AR95Book-50.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bnext.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-48.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bprev.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-48.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bup.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Btop.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bcontent.gif"></A><BR><A HREF="AR95Book-50.html">[Next] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-48.html">[Previous] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-48.html">[Up] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html">[Top] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html">[Contents]</A> <P> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
