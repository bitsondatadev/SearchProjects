<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE> Note to graduate study applicants </TITLE> </HEAD> <BODY> <FONT FACE = "helvetica"> <H2> Note to graduate study applicants and students wishing to join our lab</H2> <HR> <P> If you plan to apply for a PhD or MS at the <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/">Department of Computer Sciences</A> at <A HREF="http://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</A>, please check the <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/grad-info/">graduate information web page at http://www.cs.purdue.edu/grad-info/</A> for the steps of the application process. Please note that the department graduate admissions committee makes admission decisions, not individual faculty members. Due to the high volume of messages I receive, <em>I am unable to respond to e-mail from prospective applicants to evaluate their chances of admission</em>. <!--P> If you are interested in joining <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/fahmy/">my lab and networking research program (see http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/fahmy/)</A>, please contact me <em>after</em> you have started your studies (i.e., during your first or second year at Purdue) to discuss your research interests and ideas. <P> In most cases, I do not give research assistanships to first-semester students or to students before I work with them (e.g., on an independent study project or class project). Therefore, you may need to obtain a teaching assistanship, fellowship, or some other form of support for your first one (or more) semester(s). Most newly admitted students are supported as teaching assistants (TAs), fellows, or by ITaP in their first year, if they meet university and department requirements. <P--> Thank you for your interest in our department and good luck. <HR> <P> <ADDRESS>Last updated by: Sonia Fahmy &lt;<A HREF="mailto:fahmy@cs.purdue.edu">fahmy@cs.purdue.edu</A>&gt;<BR> August 2003</ADDRESS> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
