Brooks Fortune Distinguished Professor of Computer Sciences (1964)</EM><P> <EM> Ph.D., California Institute of Technology, 1959.</EM><P> Professor Rice is founder of the <EM>ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software</EM> and is on several other editorial boards. He is the past chair of the Computing Research Association, a fellow of the AAAS, of the ACM, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering. For the past 15 years, Professor Rice has been analyzing numerical methods and problem solving environments for scientific computing. He has created a general methodology for performance evaluation of mathematical software and developed the ELLPACK system for elliptic problems. It is now being extended to Parallel ELLPACK and PDELab. Professor Rice has published 19 books. Among recent ones are <EM>Solving Elliptic Problems with ELLPACK</EM> (Springer-Verlag, 1985), <EM>Mathematical Aspects of Scientific Software</EM> (Springer-Verlag, 1988), and <EM>Expert Systems for Scientific Computing </EM>(North Holland, 1992).<P> Projects: Computing About Physical Objects, <A HREF=AR95Book-95.html>High-Performance Computing (HPC) Methods and Systems for Partial Differential Equations (PDE)</A>, <A HREF=AR95Book-96.html>Parallel Methods and Collaborating Systems for Solving Partial Differential Equations</A>, <A HREF=AR95Book-97.html>PDE Solving Kernels and Systems for Scalable MIMD Multiprocessors</A>, <A HREF=AR95Book-98.html>PDELab: A Development and Problem Solving Environment for PDE-Based Applications on Parallel Machines</A>, <A HREF=AR95Book-99.html>PYTHIA: Using Computational Intelligence to Support Problem Solving Environments</A>, <A HREF=AR95Book-100.html>Web //ELLPACK: A Web Based Problem Solving Environment for Partial Differential Equations</A>, <A HREF=AR95Book-101.html>Science Pad</A>, <A HREF=AR95Book-104.html>Parallel Algorithms and Methods for Solving Macromolecular Structures</A>, <A HREF=AR95Book-118.html>ELLPACK System</A>, <A HREF=AR95Book-119.html>Multidisciplinary Problem Solving Environments</A> and <A HREF=AR95Book-59.html>SoftLab</A><P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/jrr"> Rice's home page</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <ADDRESS>CS Annual Report - 19 APR 1996</ADDRESS> <A HREF="AR95Book-38.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bnext.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-36.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bprev.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-6.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bup.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Btop.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bcontent.gif"></A><BR><A HREF="AR95Book-38.html">[Next] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-36.html">[Previous] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-6.html">[Up] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html">[Top] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html">[Contents]</A> <P> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
