<title> ELLPACK </title> <H1>ELLPACK</H1> <P> <h2>Software for Solving Elliptic Problems</h2> <HR> ELLPACK is a very high level, portable system for solving elliptic boundary value problems. One can solve routine problems by simply writing them down and naming the methods to be used. One can solve harder problems by using the problem solving modules in the flexible ELLPACK framework. The ELLPACK language is an easy-to-learn extension of Fortran: this provides greatly reduced coding for most of the computation, but still allows one to do special processing. ELLPACK incorporates over 50 problem solving modules, including some of the best and most current software in the world. A knowledgeable user can even tailor ELLPACK itself by adding new problem solving or analysis modules. <HR> <UL> <LI> <a href="solving.html">Solving Elliptic Problems Using ELLPACK</a><BR> This book is a complete user's guide and reference <P> <LI> ELLPACK <a href="system.html">System</a><BR> Brief description of system and problem solving capabilities <P> <LI> ELLPACK <a href="problem.html">Problem Solving Modules</a><BR> Names and descriptions of 50+ modules <P> <LI> <a href="example.html">Example</a> Program and Output <P> <LI> <a href= "how.html" > How to order</a> ELLPACK: <a href="license.html">License</a> and <a href="order.html">Order Form </a> </UL> <P> ELLPACK was first released in 1985 and since that time the ''ELLPACK Group'' has developed more sophisticated PDE solving systems and problem solving environments.
