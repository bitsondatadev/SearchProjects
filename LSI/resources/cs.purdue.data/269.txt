Our research is focused on application of parallel and distributed computing for solving large structural biology problems. Our group develops: (a) parallel algorithms and methods for processing X-ray diffraction data, (b) parallel algorithms and methods for processing cryo-electron microscopy data, (c) image processing and visualization tools, and (d) problem solving environments for structural biology. The laboratory is equiped with several high performace graphics systems and several other workstations. For more information about the research projects conducted in the lab contact: Prof. Dan C. Marinescu (dcm@cs.purdue.edu), Prof. Robert E. Lynch (rel@cs.purdue.edu) or Dr. K.C. Van Zandt (kvs@cs.purdue.edu). <p> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> </body> </html> </html>
