Prof. Eugster received his CAREER, the most prestigious NSF award for junior faculty members, with his &quot;Pervasive Programming with Event Correlation&quot; project. The CAREER program recognizes and supports the early career-development activities of teacher-scholars who are most likely to become academic leaders of the 21st century.</span></p> <p><span class="style1">Prof. Eugster's project aims at devising programming support for decentralized asynchronous distributed systems, based on the abstraction of application-level events. His approach involves three major contributions. Prof. Eugster plans to develop a model that will generalize previous approaches and unify one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many interaction. He proposes a programming language to support this model as well. The final component of this project is to develop new specific routing algorithms and protocols based on overlay networks tailored to event correlation, making use of randomization, compression, hashing, and error coding techniques to tame complexity while achieving secure, reliable and efficient event dissemination.

He received his PhD in Computer Science from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland in late 2001 and was subsequently employed as a Research Associate at his alma mater. Prior to coming to Purdue, he also worked as a Senior Software Architect for Sun Microsystems and as a Research Associate at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, Switzerland.</p> <p class="style1">Prof. Eugster's research aims at proposing adequate support for distributed programming. Particular topics of interest include fault-tolerant algorithms and programming language constructs for distributed systems.</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td width="425" height="22"><div align="center"></div></td> <td width="62"><div align="center"></div></td> <td width="300" height="22"><div align="center"></div></td> </tr> <tr> <td colspan="3"><div align="center"></div> <div align="center"></div> <div align="center"></div></td> </tr> </table> <blockquote>&nbsp;</blockquote> </body> </html> </html>
