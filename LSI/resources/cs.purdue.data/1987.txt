Such a model allows portability of programs across architectures. In the absence of such a model, programs have to be tailored to each specific architecture. This project aims at developing such abstract machine models. This project also has significant implications for conventional microprocessors with deep memory hierarchy. The issues of building spatial and temporal locality into applications are common to both parallel and uni-processors with deep memory hierarchies. <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> </body> </html> </html>
