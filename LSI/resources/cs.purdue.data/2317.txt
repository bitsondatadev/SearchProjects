If you want to be more employable and have an edge, this class will show employers that you are less likely to cause them embarrassment and cost them through mistakes. They also won't have to pay huge sums to send you to secure programming seminars and classes. This one-credit class will explain the fundamental issues in secure programming: trust management, design issues, and the many stupid little mistakes with big consequences that programmers are likely to do. No book purchase is required, as the material is entirely provided on slides. We will focus on how to do things correctly, and not on exploits (although examples will be provided for entertainment and motivational reasons). Students interested in how some exploits work may consult "Secure Coding in C/C++" (Seacord 2005, Addison-Wesley) while taking this class.</blockquote> <h3>Topics covered</h3> <ul> <li>Shell and environment <li>Buffer overflows <li>Integer overflows <li>Format strings <li>Meta-character vulnerabilities (code injection) and Input Validation <li>Web Application issues (including cross-site scripting vulnerabilities) <li>Race conditions <li>File system issues <li>Randomness </ul> <h2>Syllabus</h2> <blockquote>Cr. 1 Concurrent <B>or prior</B> registration in CS 354 or CS 355 is required.
