His research focus is on Distributed Intrusion Detection and is the main person to blame for the AAFID (<a href="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu/projects/aafid/">Autonomous Agents for Intrusion Detection</a>) system. When he is not in the office, Diego likes to spend time with his wife Susana, read (mostly anything), program for fun, and play computer games.

He plans to work on a master's degree in CS eventually, as time permits. He currently works for Delphi Automotive Systems in Kokomo, IN, about 40 miles east of Lafayette. He has been working as a software engineer there since 1997, and prior to that was an accountant for 10+ years. He earned his Bachelor's Degree in Accounting from Purdue in 1986. He got into CS because he was tired of being a user, and wanted to learn more about how computers could be used to solve problems quickly and efficiently. He lives in Lafayette with his wife Lisa, son David, and their dog Isaac. You can see lots of pictures at <A HREF="http://members.iquest.net/~czerwonky">Dan's homepage</A>. Among his non-computer related interests are basketball, volleyball, golf, softball, movies, and bridge (the card game). </TD> </TR> <TR> <TH ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP>Treasurer:</TH> <TD><A HREF="mailto:duw@cs.purdue.edu">Kevin Du</A><BR> Kevin is currently working on his Ph.D degree in computer security area in <A HREF="http://www.cerias.purdue.edu">CERIAS</A>.
