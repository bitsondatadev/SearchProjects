It should be clear that multimedia data compression is indispensable for various applications. In order to treat uniformly all the media, a new data compression scheme is required. Since most media are represented in a digital form, it is natural to apply a technique that was proved successful for inherently digital media such as text, namely Lempel-Ziv type schemes. We shall propose such a scheme that works for all media by extending lossless Lempel-Ziv to a lossy scheme based on <i>approximate pattern matching</i>. Experimental results for Pattern Matching Image Compression (PMIC) showed great potential for such a scheme. The following features of this new homogeneous pattern matching compression scheme should appeal to various applications: (i) theory (there is an information-theoretical explanation why this scheme should work well, which suggests that it may yield more reliable performance than heuristic/ad hoc approaches); (ii) fast/efficient decompression (this scheme does not require powerful computing resources on the decompression end); (iii) good handling of high frequencies (for image compression the scheme does not blur the high frequency information such as edges, etc.); (iv) uniform approach to multimedia (as mentioned above, by re-defining distortion measure we can use this approach to put together a uniform approach to all media such as text, image, video, sound, etc). <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
