Each machine also features an LCD flat panel display for greater visibility within the classroom and desk space efficiency. A similarly configured instructor station is connected to a video projector to display teaching material or guide students through programming projects. A document camera is also available in the lab. With each machine named for past winners of the ACM's Turing Award, these stations are used by all freshmen CS majors for their introductory programming courses using Java. <P> <FONT COLOR="#ce9c33" SIZE="-1"> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/ar98" TARGET="_top"> <CENTER> 1998 <BR> Annual Research Report</A> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu" TARGET="_top">Department of <BR> Computer Sciences</A> </CENTER> </FONT> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
