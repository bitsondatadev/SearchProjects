Included are coverage of risks and vulnerabilities, policy formation, controls and protection methods, database security, encryption, authentication technologies, host-based and network-based security issues, personnel and physical security issues, and issues of law and privacy.<P> --> List of Topics (By Week):<P> 1. Introduction. Issues of terminology and underlying themes. Included are issues of basic threats, vulnerabilities, and goals.<P> 2. Risk analysis and policy formation. Issues of audit and control.<P> 3. Personnel and Physical Security. Issues of how to protect physical information infrastructure, and how to select and protect personnel involved with security.<P> 4. Encryption Basics. Substitution and permutation ciphers. Attacks on encryption. Block vs. stream ciphers.<P> 5. Encryption II. Public key cryptography, digital signatures, escrowed and multi-keyed algorithms.<P> 6. Applying encryption. Key management, electronic commerce and digital cash, end-to-end arguments.<P> 7. Authentication and identification. Who are you and how do we know that?<P> 8. Malicious code. Viruses, worms, etc. Message digests and scanning as protection methods.<P> 9. Models of security. Defining security. Multi-level security. Labeling.<P> 10. Assurance methods. Formal methods, penetration testing, monitoring, auditing.<P> 11. Basic DB security. Coverage of locking, inference protection, and auditing.<P> 12. Network Security I. This is coverage of problems related to computing in a network, including eavesdropping and intrusion.<P> 13. Network Security II. Higher-level problems of security, including secure time, authentication, quality of service, etc.<P> 14. Intrusion and misuse detection and response.<P> 15. Issues of law and ethics. Discussion of legal issues relating to intellectual property, computer abuse, and law enforcement. Also discussion of additional ethical issues not discussed previously in the semester.<P> <!-- Suggested Textbooks:<P> Security in Computing by Charles Pfleeger<BR> Fundamentals of Computer Security Technology by Edward Amoroso<BR> Practical Unix and Internet Security by S.
