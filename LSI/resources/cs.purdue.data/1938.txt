<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE> Courses taught </TITLE> <BODY> <CENTER> <H1> Courses Comer Teaches At Purdue University</H1> </CENTER> <BR> <BR> I teach courses in the areas of operating systems, networking, internetworking, distributed systems, computer architecture, and software design. In addition to regular courses, I offer seminars in new research areas. <BR> <BR> <CENTER> <H2>Examples of Comer Courses</H2> </CENTER> <BR> <H2>CS 636: Internetworking</H2> <UL> <BR> This is a graduate-level course in internetwork design and architecture. It covers addressing, binding, routing, internet and application protocols, principles, and architecture of the global Internet. The focus is on the TCP/IP Internet Protocol Suite. The goals are: <UL> <LI> To acquaint students with major internet protocols, their features, details, and functionality, <LI> To introduce students to the literature, and <LI> To show students principles and abstractions underlying design choices and the consequent tradeoffs. </UL> <BR> Students will solve homework problems, read RFCs and other pertinent literature, and create a large complex computer program (usually, the semester assignment is to construct an IP router, including datagram fragmentation, reassembly, routing, and ICMP error handling). Students are given access to a processor with interfaces on three networks. The lab is attached to the global Internet. <BR> <BR> <H3>Schedule</H3> <UL> The following is a tentative outline of topics for the course. Some topics may take less time than allocated; others may take more. We will move rapidly through material that is covered in the text, spending class time on subtleties and current research issues. To some extent, speed will depend on the maturity and background of the class. </UL> <DL> <DT> 1 Introduction to internetworking. Basic networking concepts. Review of network hardware. Example networks including local and wide area networks. Packet types and packet decoding. <BR> <DT> 2 Internet concept. The TCP/IP Internet abstraction and architectural model. Internet addressing. Need for binding IP addresses. Dynamic binding and ARP protocol. <BR> <DT> 3 Datagram concept and datagram format. Datagram (IP) routing. IP Connectionless delivery service. <BR> <DT> 4 Error messages and error handling. ICMP protocol. Specifics of ICMP messages <BR> <DT> 5 Routers and datagram processing. Time-to-live. Datagram addresses and route destinations. Host-specific routes. Default (wildcard) routes. <BR> <DT> 6 Protocol layering. Purpose. Internet reference model. <BR> <DT> 7 Transport protocols. User datagram protocol (UDP) and protocol port numbers. <BR> <DT> 8 Reliable stream delivery service (TCP). Flow control, windowing, acknowledgments. Three-way handshake. Protocol state diagram. <BR> <DT> 9 Vector-distance and link-status routing algorithms. Route propagation. Core and non-core internet routing architecture. <BR> <DT> 10 Autonomous systems concept. Exterior Gateway Protocols, reachability. Path routing and BGP, weaknesses. <BR> <DT> 11 Interior gateway protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF, IS-IS). Metric manipulation. <BR> <DT> 12 Client-server model for applications. Examples. Domain name system (DNS). <BR> <DT> 13 Other application-level services including: electronic mail (SMTP), file transfer (FTP and TFTP), remote login (TELENT and ssh). <BR> <DT> 14 IPv6 model and changes. <BR> <DT> 15 Network management (SNMP, ASN.1). <BR> <DT> 16 New research topics. </DL> </UL> <BR> <BR> </HTML> </HTML>
