This 3-day workshop was held in the Computer Science building July 27-29, 2005. In it's first year the workshop attracted 10 teachers from across Indiana. Teaching backgrounds included math teachers, computer teachers, and special education teachers. One computer teacher said, &quot;I found many tips for my computer science classes.&quot; </font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The goal of the workshop was to give mathematics and computer teachers of grades 6-12 an overview of computer science and how they can naturally integrate the computer science concepts into their classrooms. Dr. Dennis Brylow, Professor Buster Dunsmore, and Professor Greg Frederickson, all of the Department of Computer Science, led workshop participants in real life problem solving efforts to help them learn the concepts of computer science logic. They covered topics such as proof by induction, recursion and algorithms. One teacher comments, &quot;I have a much greater sense of how I can encourage students in this area and the type of thinking needed.&quot; </font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The workshop included puzzles used in developing the critical thinking needed in understanding computer science. One of the fun problems presented to teachers was the Towers of Hanoi problem developed by French <img src="images/hanoi.jpg" width="444" height="129" align="right">mathematician, Edouard Lucas in 1883 <em>(pictured right).</em> This challenged participants' understanding of recursive algorithms. The problem begins with three pegs and <em>N</em> disks of ascending diameter stacked on the <em>start</em> peg. The goal is to move all the disks from the <em>start</em> peg to the <em>end</em> peg. This must be done by only moving one ring at a time and a ring can only sit on top of a larger ring. In addition to challenging teachers with such brainteasers, the Linking Computer Science to Mathematics Workshop also allowed teachers the opportunity to share ideas with other teachers who have a similar desire to create fun, exciting ways to include technology and principles of computer science in their teaching strategies. </font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For more information on the workshop visit <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/outreach/linking.htm" target="_blank">www.cs.purdue.edu/outreach/linking.htm</a>, or to show interest in the summer 2006 teacher workshop call Mindy Hart at 765-494-7802 or Bill Walker at 765-494-5890. </font></p> <p align="center">&nbsp;</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td width="357"><div align="center"></div></td> <td width="381"><div align="center"></div></td> </tr> </table> </body> </html> </html>
