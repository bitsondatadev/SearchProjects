His research group has implemented a robust and adaptable distributed database system called RAID to conduct experiments in replication control, checkpointing, and communications. He has conducted experiments in large scale distributed systems, communications, and overheads in implementing object support on top of the relational model. Professor Bhargava has recently developed an adaptable video conferencing system using the NV system from Xerox PARC. He is conducting experiments with research issues in large scale communication networks to support emerging applications such as digital library and multi-media databases. <P> Professor Bhargava is the chairman of the IEEE Symposium on Reliable and Distributed Systems that will be held in Purdue in Oct. 1998. Professor Bhargava is on the editorial board of three international journals. In the 1988 IEEE Data Engineering conference, he and John Riedl received the best paper award for their work on A Model for Adaptable Systems for Transaction Processing. Professor Bhargava is a fellow of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers and Institute of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers. He has been awarded the Gold Core Member distinction by IEEE Computer Society for his distinguished service. He received the Outstanding Instructor award from the Purdue chapter of the ACM. <P> <i>Labs:</i> <UL> <li> <A HREF="../facilities/labs/raid.html">RAID</A> </ul> <P> <i>Projects:</i> <UL> <li> <A HREF="../research/eace.html">Experiments in an Active Communication Environment</a> <li> <A HREF="../research/ass.html">Adaptable Software Systems</a> <li> <A HREF="../research/advicosy.html">Adaptable Video Conferencing Systems</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/digitlib.html">Digital Libraries</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/raid.html">Distributed Database Systems Research (RAID Project)</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/oraid.html">Distributed Object-Oriented Database Research</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/mobilecomp.html">Mobile Computing</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/supmultdata.html">Support for Multimedia Data Communication Over a Wide-Area Network</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/wiarnetrmech.html">Wide Area Network Traffic Measurement and Characterization </A> <li> <A HREF="../research/ceaqsc.html">Communication Experiments for Adaptable Quality of Service Contol</a> </UL> <p> <i>Honors and Awards:</i> <ul> <li> Best Research Paper Award, IEEE Data Engineering Conference, 1998 <li> Fellow of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) <li> Meritorious Service Certificate from IEEE Computer Society <li> Fellow of the Institute of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers. <li> Outstanding Instructor Award (ACM student chapter), 1996 <li> Golden Core Member of IEEE Computer Society </ul> <P> <A HREF="../publications/bb.html">Recent Publications</a> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/bb"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
