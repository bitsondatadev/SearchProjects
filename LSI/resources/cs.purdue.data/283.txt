<title>PacsLab</title> <head> <body> <h1> PacsLab </h1> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> <p> The parallel computation and simulation Laboratory (PacsLab) supports research that is experimental and multidisciplinary. The emphasis is on methodologies and tools for seamless, secure, scalable, and fault-tolerant concurrent computing on heterogeneous networked platforms. Central to this effort is the notion of domain-oriented software support. Current projects include research on threads systems, network protocols, active messaging communications environments, integrated network services, parallel simulation systems, and a threads-based MPI. The lab maintains a 100 Mbit subnet of 10 Dell Workstation 400s, 5 Sun SPARC 5s, a 4-processor SPARC 20, a Silicon Graphics Indigo, and access to a 140-node Intel Paragon via an ATM. The machines communicate over a 100Mbit switch. The lab was equipped with funding from the Department of Computer Sciences, NSF, ARO, and ONR. <P> For more information on PacsLab, please see <a href="/research/PaCS/PaCS.html"> http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/PaCS/PaCS.html</a> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> </body> </html> </html>
