Additional equipment and material have been added through subsequent NSF grants, contributions from the Department of Computer Sciences, and enhancement grants from SERC affiliates. The lab provides a multi-system base of resources to support the research activities of the faculty and students working in the SERC. Resources in the lab and SERC offices include a Sun server with over one gigabyte of disk space, several color and monochrome Sun SPARCstation systems with more than one gigabyte of combined local disk storage, 16 other Sun workstations, some with color monitors and local disks, PC and printer, and high-resolution laser printers. SERC offices also have an AppleTalk network with several enhanced Apple Macintosh systems, a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet scanner system, and a laser printer.<P> All the facilities in the SERC lab are connected to a local Ethernet configured as a subnet of the departmental network. The lab also includes terminals, work areas, a conference room, and a small reference library.<P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <ADDRESS>CS Annual Report - 19 APR 1996</ADDRESS> <A HREF="AR95Book-59.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bnext.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-57.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bprev.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-48.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bup.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Btop.gif"></A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html"><IMG ALIGN = BOTTOM SRC = "Bcontent.gif"></A><BR><A HREF="AR95Book-59.html">[Next] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-57.html">[Previous] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-48.html">[Up] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-1.html">[Top] </A><A HREF="AR95Book-2.html">[Contents]</A> <P> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
