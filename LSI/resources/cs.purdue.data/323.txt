He collaborates with the Arcadia consortium on software development environments, which includes researchers from several universities around the country. Currently he is developing the Concurrency Analysis Tool Suite, a collection of tool components for detecting concurrency-related bugs in software. A second research project is developing approaches for concurrency control and scheduling of hard-real-time systems with analytical guarantees of worst-case latency. Dr. Young received an NSF Presidential Young Investigator award in 1991. <P> <i>Projects:</i> <ul> <li> <A HREF="../research/arcadia.html">Arcadia</A> </ul> <P> <A HREF="../publications/young.html">Recent Publications</a> <P> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/young"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
