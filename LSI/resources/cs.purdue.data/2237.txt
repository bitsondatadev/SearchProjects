The course consists of four major parts: <ul> <li> Parallel and distributed platforms: This part of the class outlines parallel computing hardware. Topics covered include processor and memory architectures, SMP and message passing hardware, interconnection networks, network hardware, and evaluation metrics for architectures. Cost models for communication are also developed. <li> Parallel Programming: Programming models and language support for programming parallel platforms is discussed in this part. Message passing using MPI, thread-based programming using POSIX threads, and directive-based programming using OpenMP will be discussed. <li> Parallel and Distributed Algorithms: Starting from design principles for parallel algorithms, this part develops parallel algorithms for a variety of problems. Various metrics for evaluating these algorithms are also discussed. <li> Applications: A variety of parallel applications from diverse domains such as data analysis, graphics and visualization, particle dynamics, and discrete event and direct numerical simulations will be discussed. </ul> </BODY></HTML> </BODY></HTML>
