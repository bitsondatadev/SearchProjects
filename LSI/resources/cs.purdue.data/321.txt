His research interests include software systems for high-performance distributed computation, network protocols, threads systems, parallel stochastic simulation, computational probability and performance, and software engineering. His current projects include the ACES software architecture for multi-threaded distributed computing and parallel simulation, including the EcliPSe replicated simulation system (for which he was awarded an IEEE/Gordon Bell Prize), the ParaSol process-oriented distributed simulation system, the Ariadne threads system and the CLAM protocol suite. He was also awarded a German Research Council Award for Computer Networking Research. He has been an invited researcher at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories and an ACM National Lecturer. He is an Editor of the <i>IEEE Transactions on Computers</i> and an advisory board member of The DoD Advanced Distributed Simulation Research Consortium. <P> <i>Labs:</i> <UL> <li> <A HREF="../facilities/labs/pacslab.html">PacsLab</A> </ul> <P> <i>Projects:</i> <UL> <li> <A HREF="../research/aces.html">ACES Project</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/ariadne.html">Ariadne Threads System</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/arachne.html">Arachne Threads System</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/clam.html">Clam Communications System</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/eclipse.html">EcliPSe Simulation System</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/parasol.html">ParaSol Distributed Simulation System</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/display.html">The DISplay System</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/serc.html">Software Engineering Research Center (SERC)</A> </ul> <P> <A HREF="../publications/rego.html">Recent Publications</a> <P> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/rego"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
