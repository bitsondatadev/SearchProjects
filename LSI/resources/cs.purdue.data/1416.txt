Students will learn bioinformatics research topics, basic programming, and how computational methods are applied to address the research questions. <br> <br> <h3> Course topics </h3> <ul> <li> unix system, programming in Python <li> basic background about proteins, DNA, and RNA <li> biological databases <li> algorithms for biological sequence (DNA, protein) sequence alignment & database search <li> algorithms for sequence motif search <li> protein tertiary (3D) structure comparison <li> protein 3D strucure prediction from amino acid sequence <li> protein-protein interaction <li> biological network analysis <li> systems biology <li> drug protein interaction </ul> <b>These techniques are applied for answering questions including the followings: </b> <ul> <li> How function of genes can be predicted once a genome sequence of an organism (e.g. human) is determined? <li> How function of a protein can be predicted when its 3D structure is known? <li> How can we predict 3D structure of proteins? How well can we predict it? <li> How can we investigate evolution of proteins using sequence and structure information? <li> How protein structures are described and compared? <li> How different is human genome from Chimpanzee genome? <li> How did organisms (genomes) evolve? <li> how does a protein move to carry out its biological function? <li> What is the principle for computational drug design? </ul> These topics will be introduced through recent research papers and through mini projects. <h3> Grading </h3> 30% homeworks + 30% projects + 40% midterm & final exam <h3> Text books </h3> We don't use a specific textbook. Lecture notes will suffice. <br> <h3> Good Books to refer to </h3> <ul> <li> "Learning Python", 2nd edition, Mark Lutz, David Ascher, O'Reilly, ISBN: 0-596-00281-5. <li> "Biological Sequence Analysis", Durbin, Eddy, Krogh, Mitchison, ISBN 0-521-62971-3 <li> "Protein Bioinformatics", Eidhammer, Jonassen, Taylor, ISBN 0-470-84839-1 <li> "Algorithms on Strings, Trees, and Sequences" Gusfied, ISBN 0-521-58519-8 </ul> <hr> <pre> Last Modified: August/09/2011 </pre> </body> </html> </html>
