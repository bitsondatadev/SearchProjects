This overview included class schedules, dorms, Boilermaker spirit, and tests! It seems that in just one day, our incoming freshmen got to see it all. </p> <p align="left" class="style1">The CS Freshmen started their Day on Campus in MATH 175 with all the young scientists in the School of Science. After the School of Science orientation, CS academic advisors, Mary-Ann Neel &amp; Criselda Marquez, fine tuned the Purdue introduction - CS style. They discussed degree requirements and our academic advisors' role in the students' academic career. Each day one lucky freshman even got the opportunity to win a Computer Science t-shirt by answering Mary-Ann's question of the day. The CS orientation also expanded on the role of SSINFO at Purdue, password protection, and e-mail etiquette that will get students a quick response.</p> <p align="left" class="style1"><img src="images/freshman.JPG" width="425" height="324" align="right">The students and their parents were then unleashed on the Purdue campus with a hefty <em>TO DO</em> list. Some families started with a tour of the dorm. Others went directly to meet their CS advisor (either Janice Thomaz, Pat Giordano, Carol Paczolt, or Criselda). This first meeting with their advisor is when they set up their first semester of classes, and got to know the advisor that will be with them through their CS career. </p> <p align="left" class="style1">There were also placement tests to be taken, a beautiful campus to roam, ID photos to get, and email accounts to set up. It was a pretty busy day for our students and advisors, and if all the excitement called for a little recharge, freshmen and their families were welcome to stop by G25 of the CS building for some M &amp; M's, party mix and other refreshments. </p></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center">&nbsp;</td> <td align="center"><div align="right" class="style3"> <div align="center"><strong> Freshman and parents are introducted to CS. </strong></div> </div></td> </tr> <tr> <td align="center"><p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></td> <td align="center">&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
