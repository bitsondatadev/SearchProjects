<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE>Lucier</TITLE> </HEAD> <BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"> Professor Lucier's recent research concentrates on mathematical analysis of and computational methods for wavelet techniques in image processing. He has written papers on image compression, surface compression, application to compression of mammographic images, noise removal, and variational problems, in each case using nonlinear wavelet techniques to derive or analyze algorithms that are near the top of the performance range for each problem. This work is continuing, with new results in tomographic reconstruction from noisy data (with applications to Positron Emission Tomography, an important method of brain imaging), image smoothing scale spaces, etc., soon to be finished. This work is supported by the Office of Naval Research. <p> Very recently, Lucier has begun collaborating with Jens Palsberg on applying programming language transformation techniques to speed Genetic Programming systems applied to problems with large data sets, as arise, for example in image processing. This work, which has resulted in speedups up to 30 times in serial code, is supported by British Telecom. </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
