We have formulated a model of QoS provision in noncooperative network environments and presented an initial game-theoretic analysis of its properties and equilibria. Several questions remain that need to be studied about these equilibria. In particular, the assumption that the satisfaction curve of customers/applications is a unit-step needs to be removed. Furthermore, using adaptive conditioning of network parameters to jog the system into or out of equilibria has to be studied. <p> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> </body> </html> </html>
