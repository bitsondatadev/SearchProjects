<title>Collaborative Modeling and Visualization Laboratory</title> <head> <body> <TABLE> <tr> <td> <IMG ALIGN = TOP SRC="shastraMed.gif"> </td> <td> <h1> Collaborative Modeling and Visualization </h1> </td> </tr> </table> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> <p> This laboratory houses the development of SHASTRA, a distributed and collaborative modeling and visualization multimedia environment. This software system supports multi-stage scientific problem solving, involving simultaneous interactions from multiple persons and multimedia communications. Current applications include custom design of hip and knee prosthesis, shape optimization of engine-wing connections, and molecular "docking" strategies for drug screening. The laboratory currently includes one Power Indigo Onyx RE2, six Silicon Graphics Indigo 2 workstations, two Indy stations, one HP-715/75 CRX48Z graphics stations with a graphics Turbo upgrade, one IBM R-6000, one IBM Power PC 604e, one Pentium, two Power Macintoshes, and two Sun SPARCstations configured for multimedia (audio/video) communications.<p></p> <p> <img src="goldRule.gif" width=100%> </body> </html> </html>
