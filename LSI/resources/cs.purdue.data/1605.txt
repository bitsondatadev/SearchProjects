The value of <i>m</i>, range from 1 to 8, should be a command line argument. <p> The input to the IP lookup algorithm is a database that has the fields &lt;ID, prefix, mask, next hop&gt;&nbsp; one per line. The goal is to input this database and store it in a fashion such that it is amenable towards fast lookups.</p> <p> Here are three files provided:</p> <ul> <li><a href="database.txt"> Sample Database</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href="input.txt"> Sample input</a></li> </ul> <ul> <li><a href="output.txt"> Sample output</a> corresponding to the input.</li> </ul> The command line input should like the following. <br> <br> iplookup -d &lt;database file&gt; -i &lt;input file&gt; -o &lt;output file&gt; -m &lt;stride size&gt;<br> <p> While I do not care about the language you choose to implement your algorithm, I want to care about the amount of time it takes to output your results. To promote the use of efficient data structures, I would do the following. I will award 10 extra points for the submission that has the best timing among all the submissions for a test suite, different than the one that I am giving you as a sample input.</p> <p> This assignment will count <span style="font-weight: bold;">10%</span> towards your grade.</p> <h3>Analysis </h3> <p>I would want you to vary the number of bits used in the multi-bit trie to study the tradeoff between memory usage and time complexity.<br> </p> <p>In particular, I would expect you to generate a graph, with the x-axis showing the number of bits used and two y-axes one involving time complexity and the second involving memory usage.<br> </p> <p>Memory usage can be measured using the top command, while the time complexity can be measured using the unix time command. <br> </p> <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Discussions and Help</span></h3> The TA is a good source of help for this assignment. I also encourage discussion on the blackboard discussion board in case you have questions. The TA will be able to post some answers for public use.<br> <br> <p></p> <p><span style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">POLICY : Please no cheating or downloading any IP lookup algorithms publicly available. It will not be worth your cause and would lead to a reduced overall grade in the course.&nbsp; The assignment is also an individual one and no sharing of code is allowed.</span><br> </p> </body> </html> </html>
