My research area is the design and development of Problem Solving Environments for Partial Differential Equations Based Applications. Several such systems are currently under development in Purdue's <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/cse"> PSE Research Group</a>. <P> I studied Mathematics as an undergraduate and graduate student, receiving my Master's Degree in Mathematics at <a href="http://www.nd.edu/"> Notre Dame University</a> in 1980. Since then I have worked at various companies, both large (AT&T) and small (Applied Data Research) before coming to Purdue. <P> My husband David, is a professor in the <a href="http://www.math.purdue.edu/">Mathematics Department</a> at Purdue. We met at the Midwest Complex Analysis Seminar in 1979, and were married in 1980. We spent five fun years in Princeton, New Jersey, and then moved to West Lafayette. We have three wonderful children, Michael, Jason, and Lisa, who light up our lives. </font> <hr size=4> <b> [<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/acc/index.html">Homepage</a>] [<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/acc/contents.html">Introduction</a>] [<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/acc/research.html">Research</a>] [<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/acc/resume.html">Resume</a>] [<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/acc/publ.html">Publications</a>] [<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/acc/family.html">Family</a>] [<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/acc/hobbies.html">Hobbies</a>] [<a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/acc/vakay.html">Fun Vacations</a>] </b> </body> </html> </html>
