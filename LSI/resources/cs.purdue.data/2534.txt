To verify age bring your driver&#039;s license or passport with you. To make sure fake IDs are not used by people underage, many places around campus require you to bring two forms of identification. The first form will be your driver&#039;s license or passport. The second form can be anything issued to you that has your name on it. This includes a credit card, student ID, pay-stub (though I have never seen anyone actually try this), etc. </p> <p> Bars are open until 3 AM Monday through Saturday. Some bars may be open on Sunday, but most are closed due to lack of business. You can buy alcohol at grocery stores (hard liquor included) or liquor stores. However, alcohol sale is prohibited at these places on Sunday. </p> </div> <!-- SECTION "The Basics" [1-804] --> <h1><a name="beer_cs" id="beer_cs">Beer @ CS</a></h1> <div class="level1"> <p> If you want to join a group that goes to various bars and restaurants each week, join the “beer” mailing list. Although the name suggests drinking, you are welcome to join and just enjoy the food. Beer @ CS typically meets every Thursday around 6 PM. </p> </div> <!-- SECTION "Beer @ CS" [805-1082] --> <h1><a name="campus" id="campus">Campus</a></h1> <div class="level1"> <p> Most campus bars are located on top of Chauncey Hill. A few can also be found if you go down to Wabash Landing. These are most frequented by undergraduates, so if you are tired of that scene you may wish to go to Downtown Lafayette (see below). However, the cheapest alcohol is found here. </p> </div> <!-- SECTION "Campus" [1083-1398] --> <h2><a name="bars" id="bars">Bars</a></h2> <div class="level2"> </div> <!-- SECTION "Bars" [1399-1415] --> <h3><a name="chauncey_hill" id="chauncey_hill">Chauncey Hill</a></h3> <div class="level3"> </div> <h4><a name="jake_s" id="jake_s">Jake&#039;s</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> Free hotdogs and popcorn Saturday nights. Decent food menu. </p> </div> <h4><a name="harry_s_chocolate_shop" id="harry_s_chocolate_shop">Harry&#039;s Chocolate Shop</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> Often crowded. Horrible food. </p> </div> <h4><a name="brother_s" id="brother_s">Brother&#039;s</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> Most popular on Friday. </p> </div> <h4><a name="where_else" id="where_else">Where Else?</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> One of two places to go dancing. $0.25 pitchers on Wednesday ($3 cover). </p> </div> <h4><a name="wabash_yatch_club_aka_stacks" id="wabash_yatch_club_aka_stacks">Wabash Yatch Club (aka Stacks)</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> Considered a frat bar. </p> </div> <h4><a name="boiler_market" id="boiler_market">Boiler Market</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> Good food. Every day special of a pitcher (any beer you want) and 12 wings for ~$10. Pitcher and one-topping pizza for ~$13. Closes early. </p> </div> <!-- SECTION "Chauncey Hill" [1416-1941] --> <h3><a name="wabash_landing" id="wabash_landing">Wabash Landing</a></h3> <div class="level3"> </div> <h4><a name="neon_cactus" id="neon_cactus">Neon Cactus</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> Home of the piano bar and the largest dance floor in the area (seperate areas of the same bar). The piano bar is very popular and worth going to at least once while you are at Purdue. The Cactus is very popular on Thursdays due to its drink specials. Buy a 32 oz. mug (~$3, or bring a mug that you bought previously from the bar) and fill it up with beer ($0.10) or well mixers ($1.50). The other nights they are open, Friday and Saturday, also have good specials. There is a $5 cover each night. </p> </div> <h4><a name="pete_s" id="pete_s">Pete&#039;s</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> A popular place years ago and was recently re-opened Spring 2007. The owner has good food and drink specials to try and attract students. </p> </div> <h4><a name="scotty_s" id="scotty_s">Scotty&#039;s</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> Good food, but do not recommend going there. The last time Beer @ CS went there, two people&#039;s credit card numbers were stolen. Even though it was not proven that the numbers were stolen there, comparing the credit card statements basically points a finger at this place. </p> </div> <h4><a name="bw3s" id="bw3s">BW3s</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> Like any typical BW3s. Thursday is $0.50 boneless wings and $3.00 cheeseburgers. </p> </div> <h4><a name="nine_irish_brothers" id="nine_irish_brothers">Nine Irish Brothers</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> The only Irish pub in the area. They have live music on most Fridays and often show soccer or rugby on their TVs. A nice patio area that has space warmers for nights that get a little chilly. Attracts a more upscale crowd, most likely due to the price of their food and beer. </p> </div> <!-- SECTION "Wabash Landing" [1942-3336] --> <h2><a name="breakfast_club" id="breakfast_club">Breakfast Club</a></h2> <div class="level2"> <p> Purdue has a tradition known as Breakfast club. This means that students hit the campus bars at Chauncey Hill around 7 AM. This happens on football game day Saturdays during the Fall, and once during the Spring, Purdue Grand Prix. If you plan to go (and you should go at least once while you are at Purdue), wear a costume. If you do not, you will be one of the very few who did not, and will be heckled. </p> <p> On campus you will often see shirts that say “Go Ugly Early”. Going “ugly” refers to getting drunk, with the slogan orginating from Harry&#039;s. Harry&#039;s rival, Jake&#039;s, countered that slogan with their own popular t-shirt slogan of “No Uglies Allowed”. </p> </div> <!-- SECTION "Breakfast Club" [3337-4026] --> <h2><a name="late_night_snack" id="late_night_snack">Late Night Snack</a></h2> <div class="level2"> <p> Many places stay open to get that closing-time food rush. Taco Bell, Arby&#039;s, and Qdoba (burrito place) stay open. If you want breakfast type food, or generally hate your body, go to Triple XxX. </p> </div> <!-- SECTION "Late Night Snack" [4027-4252] --> <h1><a name="downtown_lafayette" id="downtown_lafayette">Downtown Lafayette</a></h1> <div class="level1"> <p> Located right across the Wabash river is the Downtown Lafayette area. There are numerous bars and restaurants, most of which are more upscale than the campus bars. Since it often requires a short drive for students, few undergraduates make their way over the river. </p> </div> <!-- SECTION "Downtown Lafayette" [4253-4555] --> <h2><a name="bars1" id="bars1">Bars</a></h2> <div class="level2"> </div> <h4><a name="hunter_s_pub_down_under" id="hunter_s_pub_down_under">Hunter&#039;s Pub Down Under</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> As the name suggests, the bar is located underground. </p> </div> <h4><a name="chumley_s" id="chumley_s">Chumley&#039;s</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> By far the largest beer menu selection. 50 different beers on tap plus 50+ others from the bottle. Thursday is schooner night. Buy the schooner (32 oz glass) and get a discount on your alcohol purcahse. You can keep and bring back the schooner. </p> </div> <h4><a name="sergent_preston_s" id="sergent_preston_s">Sergent Preston&#039;s</a></h4> <div class="level4"> </div> <h4><a name="lafayette_brewing_company" id="lafayette_brewing_company">Lafayette Brewing Company</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> They brew their own beer. Some people are obsessed with it. </p> </div> <h4><a name="spurlock_s" id="spurlock_s">Spurlock&#039;s</a></h4> <div class="level4"> <p> Some nights they have very cheap domestic drafts. </p> </div> <!-- SECTION "Bars" [4556-] --></div> </body> </html> </html>
