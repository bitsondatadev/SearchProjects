The goal of the Midwest Database Research Symposium is to strengthen the ties between these individuals and encourage future discussions, interactions and collaborations, through a day of interaction and networking once a year. To foster on-to-one interaction, this year's Symposium will focus on poster sessions and demos. We will have two "split" poster sessions (so people have a chance to see posters from all other schools), with sufficient room for every attendee who wants to (and even some non-attendees) to have a poster. There will also be room for attendees to present demos along with their posters. </p> <p> <a id="registration" /> Attendees will register on site to receive a name tag. No preregistration is needed, other than a headcount of attendees from each school's coordinator. Each school's coordinator should also send a headcount of demo presenters, as there is limited demo space. Information will be available at the registration desk on the day of the symposium about where to set up demos and posters and how to get wireless access. <!--, and where to go for lunch.--> </p><p> If you are interested in attending and your University isn't listed (or if you aren't at a University), please contact Chris Clifton (<img alt="clifton at cs.purdue.edu" src="clifton.png" />) with the name and email of the contact for your institution (e.g., yourself.) </p> <p> <a id="technical" /> We expect attendees this year from the following institutions: </p> <table> <tr><th>School</th><th>Contact</th><th>Faculty</th><th>Students</th><th>Posters</th><th>Demos</th></tr> <tr><td>Spring Arbor University</td><td>Shasha Wu (swu@arbor)</td><td> 1 </td><td> 0-2 </td><td> 1 </td><td> 0 </td></tr> <tr><td>Case</td><td>Z.

S. Huang is the William L. Everitt Distinguished Professor </p> <p> <em>Abstract:</em> Until recently and even today most information </p>--> <p> <a id="location" /> All sessions of the Symposium will be held at the the new <a href="http://news.uns.purdue.edu/UNS/html3month/2004/041016.Lawson.building.html">Richard and Patricia Lawson Computer Science Building</a> at Purdue University, at the <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/campus_map/areas/def_456.html">northwest corner of 3rd and University streets</a> in West Lafayette. The address is 305 N. University Street, West Lafayette, IN 47907-2107. Parking is available free of charge (after 5pm on Friday) in the parking structure across the street (southwest corner of 3rd and University.) Most mapping services seem to give pretty good directions to the above address. </p> <p> If you need accomodations, be aware that due to West Lafayette's wonderful reputation as a spring break hot spot, hotels may be hard to find. Seriously, it seems to be some sort of parents weekend and <a href="http://www.ces.purdue.edu/sfest">Spring Fest</a> (where you can do such fun things as <a href="http://www.entm.purdue.edu/bugbowl/events.html">have insects for lunch</a>) and the decent hotels in West Lafayette are booked. Quite a bit available at reasonable prices in Lafayette, however. For those on a tight budget, we can arrange some private housing with faculty/students - contact Chris Clifton (<img alt="clifton at cs.purdue.edu" src="clifton.png" />) if you need such arrangements. </p> <h3><a id="dates" />Rules for Demos and Posters</h3> <ol> <li>Demos <ul> <li>Each person presenting a demo should bring a laptop that can run the demo.</li> <li>Wireless internet access will be available for demos. Power may not be available in the demo area, so precharge laptop batteries.</li> <li>Everyone who wants to do a demo can do one, subject to space limitations. Each school should choose their own demos and send a headcount of demo presenters to <img alt="clifton at cs.purdue.edu" src="clifton.png" /> to ensure that there is sufficient table space for all demo presenters.</li> </ul></li> <li>Posters <ul> <li>Print out your poster, attach it to a stiff backing of foam board or cardboard, and bring it to the Symposium with you. We will set up easels to hold your posters in the Lawson building commons.</li> <li> The easels have an A-frame shape and will accept a poster on stiff poster board. If your poster is floppy, then bring some small clips with you so that you can clip it to the back of someone else's (stiff) poster to keep it from falling off the easel. </li> <li>The exact size and form of the poster is up to the presenter.</li> </ul></li> </ol> <h4>Best Posters of 2007</h4> <p> Thanks to the efforts of Professors Beth Plale (IU), Ruoming Jin (Kent State), Lorenzo Martino (Purdue), and Luo Si (Purdue), we would like to announce the following awards for best posters of 2007: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Most Novel</strong>: <q>Update Conscious bitmap Indices</q>, Guadalupe Canahuate, Mike Gibas, and Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu, Ohio State. </li> <li><strong>Best Presented</strong>: <q>Periscope/SQ: Interactive Data Exploration for Biological sequences</q>, Sandeep Tata, Willis Lang, You Jung Kim, and Jignesh M.
