The architecture allows authenticated and casual users to acquire guaranteed shares of system resources. It also allows the resource requirements of web objects to be described, to achieve predictable performance. The web server runs on top of an operating system developed at Purdue that treats resource allocations as orthogonal kernel objects. This allows to implement fair acceptance order of connection requests, as well as fair dropping of requests to prevent long-term system overload. OS resource principals that serve admitted requests can also have fine-grained and highly flexible bindings to appropriate resource allocations. We present system performance using a combination of simulation results and performance results obtained from an Apache server running on an Ultra-1 workstation. <p> <hr> <p> <em> The <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/nsl/colloquium.html"> Network Systems Colloquium</a> is sponsored by the <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/nsl">Network Systems Lab</a> at <a href="http://www.purdue.edu/"> Purdue University</a>.
