Specific research areas include self-similar traffic control, real-time/multimedia traffic control, Internet quality of service (QoS) provision architectures, distributed operating systems, fault-tolerance in distributed systems, and ATM network security. The research projects are supported by grants from NSF (ANI-9714707, ESS-9806741), PRF, and Sprint. Additional equipment support is provided by FORE Systems and Intel. Equipment housed in NSL include several UltraSparc and Intel based workstations, two private subnets (one ATM and one FastEthernet), video/audio capture devices, and a laser printer. NSL is located in room G16 of the Computer Science Building. <p> For more information visit the <a href="//www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/park/nsl.html" TARGET="_top">Network Systems Lab.</a> <P> <FONT COLOR="#ce9c33" SIZE="-1"> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/ar98" TARGET="_top"> <CENTER> 1998 <BR> Annual Research Report</A> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu" TARGET="_top">Department of <BR> Computer Sciences</A> </CENTER> </FONT> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
