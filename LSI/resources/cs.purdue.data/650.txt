Bajaj</H1> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <P> <EM> Professor of Computer Sciences (1984)</EM> <P> <EM> Ph.D., computer science, Cornell University, 1984.</EM> <P> Professor Bajaj's research is in the areas of computer graphics, geometric modeling and data visualization. In particular, he develops novel approaches to representing, reasoning about, displaying and interacting with computer models of physical domains with associated physics. Current approaches include the use of combinatorial, algebraic and differential geometry to devise data structures that support multi-resolution approximations of very large domains and multiple function fields, an integrated parallel framework for domain modeling, physics calculations and interrogative visualization mapped onto high performance computational testbeds, and collaborative user interfaces for navigation and interrogation of multi-dimensional information on stereo displays. Bajaj masterminded the SHASTRA project on collaborative modeling and visualization at Purdue University from it inception in 1987 and credibly directed the Purdue Center of Computational Image Analysis and Data Visualization from 1995-1997. In September '97, he became the University of Texas' first CAM Chair holder in Visualization and director of the Center of Computational Visualization within TICAM (Texas Institute of Computational and Applied Mathematics). <P> Bajaj is on the editorial board of the <i>ACM Transactions on Graphics</i> and the <i>International Journal of Computational Geometry and Applications</i>, and is the Computer Graphics Area Editor for the <i>Wiley Worldwide Series in Computer Science</i>. Bajaj's work on Geometric Modeling with Algebraic Splines has been funded by NSF. He is currently the PI for an AFOSR funded project to develop desktop visualization algorithms for scalar, vector and tensor fields, as well as an ONR funded project for Interrogative Visualization and Virtual Reality on very large stereoscopic displays. <P> <i>Labs:</i> <ul> <li> <A HREF="../facilities/labs/cmv.html">Collaborative Modeling and Visualization</a> </ul> <P> <i>Projects:</i> <ul> <li> <A HREF="../research/alalgeo.html">Algorithmic Algebraic Geometry</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/efaldast.html">Efficient Algorithms and Data Structures in Computer Aided Geometric Design</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/intervis.html">Interrogative Visualization of Multidimensional Data</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/movipobi.html">Modeling and Visualization for Polymers and Biomolecules</A> <li> <A HREF="../research/shastra.html">Project SHASTRA: Distributed and Collaborative Synthetic Environments</A> </ul> <P> <A HREF="../publications/bajaj.html">Recent Publications</A> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/bajaj"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
