First, we are interested in assessing the performance of Xinu compared to systems that run only on Intel processors. Second, the Crosspoint project, which is investigating wireless internetworking, is using Pentium machines as wireless base stations, and will use Xinu for protocol experimentation. Third, students in operations system and network classes will be using Xinu for hands-on experimentation.<P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
