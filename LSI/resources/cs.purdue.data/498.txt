The award is effective February 15, 2010 through January 31, 2015 and is valued at $424,166.</p> <p class="style1">Koyuturk’s proposal, “Computational Models and Algorithms for Differential Network Analysis in Systems Biology” received an award valued at $80,275. It is effective from February 1, 2010 to January 31, 2011 (estimated).</p> <p class="style1">Mokbel won for his proposal, “Extensible Personalization of Spatial and Spatio-temporal Database Management Systems.” His research will develop extensible methods, inside the database engine, that efficiently support a wide variety of personalized spatial and spatio-temporal queries. The award is effective Mar, 31, 2010 through February 28, 2015 and is valued at $530,000.</p> <p class="style1">Jiang received his PhD in Computer Science from Purdue in 2006. While a student at Purdue, Dongyan Xu was his advisor. He received his M.S. in Computer Science in 2001, and his B.S. in Information Science and Technology in 1998 from Xi’an Jiaotong University, China. His research interests are in virtual machines (VMs) and security. Jiang is currently an assistant professor of Computer Science at North Carolina State University.</p> <p class="style1">Koyuturk received his PhD in Computer Science from Purdue in 2006. Ananth Grama and Wojciech Szpankowski were his advisors while at Purdue. He received his MS in Computer Engineering in 2000 and his BS in Electrical and Electronics Engineering in 1998 from Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. His main area of research is Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, with emphasis on development of algorithms for data analysis in Systems Biology. He now serves as an assistant professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Case Western Reserve University.</p> <p class="style1">Mokbel received his PhD in Computer Science from Purdue in 2005. While he was a student at Purdue, Walid Aref was his advisor. He received his M.S. and his B.S. in Computer Science from Alexandria University, Egypt in 1999 and 1996, respectively. His research interests are in database systems, location-based services, and GIS. Mokbel is currently an assistant professor of Computer Science at University of Minnesota -- Twin Cities.</p> <p class="style1">The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a Foundation-wide activity that offers the National Science Foundation's most prestigious awards in support of the early career-development activities of those teacher-scholars who most effectively integrate research and education within the context of the mission of their organization.</p> <span class="style1"><br /> </td> </tr> </table> </body> </html> </html>
