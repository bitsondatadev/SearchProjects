<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE> Errata for TCP/IP Volume 3 (WINSOCKET)</TITLE> </HEAD> <BODY> <H2> Internetworking With TCP/IP Volume 3 (Windows Sockets version) </H2> <BR> Pages 28-31, consum.cpp <UL> The printed version of the code for program consum.cpp contains a typo in the declaration of the first argument in the call to _beginthread (note that the code available for FTP is correct). The incorrect line, which appears three times on pages 28 through 31, should read: <BR> <BR> <CENTER> <PRE> _beginthread((void (*) (void *))addem, 0, (void *)5); </PRE> </CENTER> </UL> <BR> <BR> <NL> Page 155, daytime.cpp <UL> Unlike Berkeley Unix, the Windows Sockets implementation of FD_SET does not maintain a true set. Thus, multiple calls to set a given descriptor will add multiple entries. Move the call to FD_ZERO() into the beginning of the while loop before the calls to FD_SET(). </UL> <BR> <BR> Page 381, fsminit.cpp <UL> Incorrect initialization of ``invalid'' states of the finite state. Although there is no way to reach these states, the intention was to initialize the entries to abort. Change the loop to use a new index, ti2 as in the following: <BR> <BR> <PRE WIDTH=66> /* set all uninitialized indices to an invalid transition */ for (cn=0; cn&lt;NCHRS; ++cn) for (ti2=0; ti2&lt;nstates; ++ti2) if (fsm[ti2][cn] == TINVALID) fsm[ti2][cn] = ti; </PRE> </UL> <BR> <BR> <H4><A HREF="netbooks.html#vol3.win">Return to list of Comer's networking books</A></H4> <BR> <H4><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/comer">Return to Comer's homepage</A></H4> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
