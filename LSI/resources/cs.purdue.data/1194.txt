He is the President and CEO of T.H.E., Inc. and serves on the Boards of Directors for Aquila, Inc., Reader's Digest Association, Inc., and Hallmark Cards Incorporated. Cain's daughter Melanie Cain-Jackson and his son Vincent Cain accompanied him to the ceremony on Sunday. </p> <p align="left" class="style6"><span class="style6">Cain earned a deg</span>ree in mathematics from Morehouse College in 1967 and while working as a mathematician for the Department of the Navy, he earned his master's degree in computer science from Purdue University. Cain worked as a business analyst for The Coca-Cola Company and Vice President of Corporate Systems and Services of The Pillsbury Company before seeking greater challenges of corporate presidency. </p> <p align="left" class="style6">He moved on to Pillsbury's Burger King Division. Only nine months after joining Burger King, he was managing 400 units in the Philadelphia region. Pillsbury then appointed Cain President of the Godfather's Pizza, Inc. in 1986. The financially-troubled chain regained profitability in 14 short months of Cain's presidency, and, in 1988, he led a buyout of the company from Pillsbury. In 1998 Cain was elected to the Board of Directors of the National Restaurant Association. His leadership of the association into national debates and speeches concerning health care reform, employment policies, and taxation led to his appointment to serve on the Economic Growth and Tax Reform Commission. He then became a senior advisor to the 1996 Dole/Kemp campaign for the Presidency, and in 2002, he became an Executive Lecturer for the Gallup Organization.</p> <p align="left" class="style6">Herman Cain shares his secrets to success and leadership through his consulting firm T.H.E. Inc. (The Hermanator Experience). T.H.E. shares Herman's message of leadership through books, videotapes and audio tapes, CDs of gospel music, and his keynote speeches. He has authored three books to date: <em>CEO of Self</em>, <em>Leadership is Common Sense</em>, and <em>Speak as a Leader</em>. </p> <p align="center" class="style6"><img src="images/hcain3.jpg" width="500" height="327"></p> </TD> </TR> <TR> <TD colspan="2" ALIGN="LEFT"><div align="center" class="style6 style7"><strong>Herman Cain with his children. </strong></div></TD> </TR> <TR> <TD colspan="2" ALIGN="LEFT"><span class="style6">Source: <br> <a href="http://www.hermancain.com/biography-narrative.asp" target="_blank">http://www.hermancain.com/biography-narrative.asp</a></span></TD> </TR> </TABLE> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
