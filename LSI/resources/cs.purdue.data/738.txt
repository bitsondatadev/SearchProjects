As we continue to become more dependent on these platforms in our daily lives, we naturally want to be able to trust that they will not fail under these attacks. Building a basis for being able to trust the robustness of our computing platforms is the subject of this talk. Topics covered will include the problems, promises, concepts, practical realities, and research opportunities in the Trustworthy Platform arena. Of particular interest are methods for dealing with legacy, system integration, and manageability issues.</p> <p align="left"><a href="http://www.intel.com/technology/techresearch/people/bios/cox_w.htm" target="_blank">BIO</a>:<img src="images/intel.gif" width="200" height="100" align="right"><br> Dr. George Cox is strategist/architect with multiyear focus on use of security technologies to solve trustworthy platform and distributed system problems.
