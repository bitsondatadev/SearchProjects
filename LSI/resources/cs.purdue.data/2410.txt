See below to see how to create the key string<br> find method -- accepts an object of Board as the only parameter, returns the position where you find the Board. It returns null if the Board is not in the tree.<br> insert method -- accepts a key string of a Board and the Board as the parametersin that order, returns the position where the Board is inserted to the tree<br> remove method -- accepts a position, returns the key string<br> <hr> CheckedList - rewrite it so that it uses RedBlackTree. <br> <B>IMPORTANT:</B> Name the object of RedBlackTree as <FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Checked_list</FONT> <br> You must implement all methods that indicated in the CheckedListAbstract.java<br> <p> <hr> You need to create a key for a board based on the pattern of the board. You need to convert the 16 integers to 16 hex values and form them as a String, which will be the key for the board. <br> <p> For example, <br> <P> <TABLE CELLSPACING=4 BORDER=2> <TR> <TD>0</TD> <TD>3</TD> <TD>4</TD> <TD>5</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD>10</TD> <TD>11</TD> <TD>14</TD> <TD>15</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD>2</TD> <TD>1</TD> <TD>6</TD> <TD>7</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD>8</TD> <TD>9</TD> <TD>12</TD> <TD>13</TD> </TR> </TABLE> <p> The key for the above board would be 0345ABEF216789CD <P> </FONT> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
