Gleich will join the computer science faculty as an Assistant Professor, effective fall 2011.</p> <p class="style1">His research interests are in large scale matrix computations, numerical graph algorithms, and sparse matrix computations. Much of his thesis work was on Google’s seminal PageRank algorithm.</p> <p class="style1">"Dr. Gleich is an outstanding young researcher and will make an excellent addition to our department. He adds to our existing strengths in High Performance Computing and brings exciting opportunities for collaboration with researchers in other areas including Machine Learning," says Sunil Prabhakar, Interim Head for the Department of Computer Science.</p> <p class="style1">Gleich received his MS and PhD in computational and mathematical engineering from Stanford University in 2006 and 2009, respectively.</p> <p class="style1">He earned his BS in mathematics and computer science from Harvey Mudd College in 2004. After his tenure as a “Mudder” and a Stanford “Tree”; he is looking forward to the opportunity to be a “Boilermaker” instead.</p> <p class="style1">Before coming to Purdue, Dr. Gleich will be completing the prestigious <a href="http://www.cs.sandia.gov/VN_Web_Page/" target="_blank">John von Neumann postdoctoral fellowship</a> at Sandia National Laboratories, Livermore, CA. The John von Neumann postdoctoral fellowship provides an exceptional opportunity for innovative research in computational mathematics and scientific computing on advanced computing architectures with application to a broad range of science and engineering problems of national importance. As part of this fellowship, he is using the complete eigenvalue information associated with various real-world graphs to study their characteristics. These computations involve extremely large, dense eigenvalue problems on distributed clusters, including a few of the top-10 supercomputers. </p> <p class="style1">More information on Dr. Gleich can be found at his <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~dgleich/" target="_blank">website</a>. He is also an avid tweeter, and goes by @dgleich on Twitter. In his “copious” free time, he also enjoys cooking, photography, and skiing. </p> <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p> <p class="style1"> <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p> <p class="style1">&nbsp;</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table> </body> </html> </html>
