Of particular interest to him are issues of neuromorphic modeling of visual systems, as well as the use of soft AI approaches for approximate reasoning. He is working on using techniques from Computational Intelligence and Agent-based systems to aid in the effort to create Multidisciplinary PSEs. This work also addresses the problems involved in supporting such PSEs on mobile platforms, and using such systems to improve pedagogical techniques.<P> His other research activity deals with exploring the nature of motion correspondence process, using information from Neurobiology and Psychophysics. In collaboration with colleagues from Psychology, he is working on understanding the effect of the geometry of visual space on the human problem solving ability.<P> <i>Projects:</i> <ul> <li> CS&amp;E Program, <A HREF="../research/pythia.html">PYTHIA: Using Computational Intelligence to Support Problem Solving Environments</A>, <li> <A HREF="../research/sciencepad.html">SciencePad</A>, <li> <A HREF="../research/vghps.html">Vision, Geometry and Heuristic Problem Solving</A> </ul> <P> <A HREF="../publications/joshi.html">Recent Publications</a> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/joshi"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
