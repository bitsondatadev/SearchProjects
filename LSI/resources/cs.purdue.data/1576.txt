It consists of sequential and parallel equation discretizers for both finite element and finite difference methods, sequential and parallel linear system solvers, nonlinear solvers, solution evaluators, and error and performance estimators. <P> <HR> The PDEPack architecture follows the object-based standard required of all PDELab components. PDEPack is not merely a repository for PDE systems and solvers, it also defines standard representations for the data structures and computational components that are necessary for all phases of numerical simulation. <P> PDEPack provides a development platform for building numerical solver components for PDE problems. These include the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines) software, discretization kernals, and linear system solvers. There is a virtual parallel environment for implementing portable parallel solvers, and several methodologies for the parallelization of sequential code. <P> PDEPack is a framework for integrating existing PDE solvers, libraries, model-specific solvers, and entire PDE-solving systems. The existance of a standard representation for the objects which are intrinsic to the PDE-solving process provides a uniform mechanism for the transformation of PDEPack objects to the specification required by the existing software. In fact, multiple representations of these objects have been defined in order to support the compile-execution and the interpret-execution models used within the PDELab environment. <P> <BODY> </BODY> <P> <HR> <ADDRESS><IMG SRC="../../gifs/pdelab/pdelab-logo-emboss.gif"> For further information contact pdelab@cs.purdue.edu</ADDRESS> pdelab@cs.purdue.edu</ADDRESS>
