<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE>Yau</TITLE> </HEAD> <BODY BGCOLOR="WHITE"> David Yau's research interests are in quality of service (QoS) support for emerging network computing. In CPU scheduling, he has designed and built adaptive fair share and deadline based schedulers, and is studying their simultaneous application for decoupled delay and rate guarantees. In protocol processing, he is investigating interprocess communication abstractions with QoS properties, and protocol implementation techniques for minimizing <i>hidden scheduling</i> in network access. He aims to synthesize these works with related research results into an innovative computing platform called <i>Concerto</i>, which is being prototyped for a heterogeneous internetwork of end computers and integrated services IP gateways. <p> Dr. Yau is the recipient of a 1998 CAREER award from the National Science Foundation. </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
