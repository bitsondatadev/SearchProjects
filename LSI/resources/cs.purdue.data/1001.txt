In previous work, Dr. Park and his co-workers have demonstrated a simple, high-level causal mechanism for inducing self-similar network traffic and they have investigated the detrimental effect of self-similarity on network performance. In current work, the focus has shifted from the causal/impact aspect of self-similar traffic to its control. Of particular interest is the use of adaptive forward error correction (AFEC) in the transport of QoS-sensitive real-time multi-media traffic. It can be shown that FEC-based systems belong to a class of congestion-susceptible systems. Techniques developed for these type of systems can be adopted to the analysis and design of AFEC control algorithms with desirable properties. <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
