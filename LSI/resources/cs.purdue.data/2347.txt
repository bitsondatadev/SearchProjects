DeVore and Lucier have initiated investigations into multidimensional scalar conservation laws with the hope of extending their univariate results to this setting. Their previous results show: (i) the Besov spaces <IMG SRC="AR95Book-103-image-7.gif">, <IMG SRC="AR95Book-103-image-8.gif">, <IMG SRC="AR95Book-103-image-9.gif"> (roughly speaking, these are the spaces of functions with <IMG SRC="AR95Book-103-image-10.gif"> derivatives in <IMG SRC="AR95Book-103-image-11.gif">) are regularity spaces for scalar conservation laws in one space dimension, and (ii) there are numerical methods based on moving grids that can achieve arbitrary prescribed orders of approximation, namely, for any initial condition in <IMG SRC="AR95Book-103-image-12.gif">, the solution can be recovered to error <IMG SRC="AR95Book-103-image-13.gif"> in the metric of <IMG SRC="AR95Book-103-image-14.gif"> by a numerical method based on moving grids.<P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
