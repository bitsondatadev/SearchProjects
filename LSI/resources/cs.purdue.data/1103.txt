<HTML> <TITLE>DISplay Homepage</TITLE> <!-- Changed by: Edward Mascarenhas, 9-May-1996 --> <IMG ALT="DISplay" ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="pics/display.gif"> <P> <BR> <DT><H2><IMG ALT="o " SRC="pics/bluedot.gif"> Description</H2> <DD><I>DISplay</I> is a visualization and user-interaction toolkit for distributed computing environments. An end-user may use the system to develop a graphical interface for interaction with the application and real-time dynamic displays of results. <P> The system has been used in several application areas including particle physics, numerical analysis, simulated annealing, performance monitoring of parallel computations, and algorithm visualization. <P> The software architecture is C++ based, utilizing support from X11, PEX, and Motif for graphical displays. Its design allows for the addition of new features. <P> At the current time DISplay supports two-way interactions between a user and the application, allowing an application to be configured to respond to user actions. It also supports a variety of tasks (i.e., specific graphical displays) including scatter diagrams, line plots with multiple series, histograms, level graphs, 3D graphs, and network diagrams.<P> A future release of DISplay is planned with task support for arcs, polygons, and 3D surfaces. DISplay permits multiple processes to write to a single task, enabling a unified view of a display from a distributed computation.<P> Motivated by parallel simulation applications, DISplay permits time-based sequencing/queueing of graphics requests, enabling consistent view of results from parallel/distributed computations. <DT><H2><IMG ALT="o " SRC="pics/bluedot.gif"> Principal Investigators</H2> <DD><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/edm">Edward Mascarenhas</A>, PhD Student <DD><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/rego">Dr. Vernon Rego</A>, Major Professor <DT><H2><IMG ALT="o " SRC="pics/bluedot.gif"> Publications</H2> <DD> <DT><IMG SRC="/images/papericon.xbm"> E.
