His early schooling, from 1953 until 1965, took place in Mathura, Jabalpur, and Calcutta. He liked listening to music and often composed parodies for the entertainment of his friends. He won a few prizes from Benji-League in the children's category for writing original short stories. Much to the disliking of his father, he spent more time playing cricket with his friends than studying for examinations or completing home work. Only two of his early poems have survived. These were written by Aditya in 1965 during a winter camp of the National Cadet Core (NCC). One of these poems was perhaps written in collaboration with his close friend Ashwini Agrawal. There is no record of his early parodies.&nbsp;</i></font></p> <p><font color="#000066"><i><b>College Education: </b></i></font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" color="#000066"><i>Aditya received his college education from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (known as BITS) located in Pilani in the state of Rajasthan. He acquired his Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral degrees in 1970, 1972, and 1977, respectively, in Electrical Engineering. In 1973, with a few colleagues at BITS, he established the second Computer Science department in India. From 1983 until 1985 he was the head of this department. In 1985 he moved to Georgia Tech in Atlanta, USA. In 1987 he joined Purdue University located in West Lafayette in the state of Indiana. He is now a Professor in the Department of Computer Science.&nbsp;</i></font></p> <p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" color="#000066"><i>There is no record of any artistic activity by Aditya from his college days. Programming computers and playing Table Tennis occupied most of his time. He maintained a deep interest in Indian popular music and would see films several times over for the sake of listening to his favorite songs.</i></font><i><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times"> </font></i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" color="#000066"><i>Interestingly, sometime during the years 1973-75, a co-worker in the Computer Science department asked Aditya and other colleagues to fill out a questionnaire. Based on the answers given this co-worker wondered: &quot;How come you are in Computer Science? You should have been an artist!&quot;&nbsp;</i></font></p> <p><font color="#000066"><i><b>Family: </b></i></font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" color="#000066"><i>Aditya is the eldest amongst four brothers and one sister. He is married to Jyoti. Jyoti is educated in Mathematics and Computer Science. She has 10 years of training in Sitar performance. Jyoti and Aditya have two children. Daughter Gitanjali is an exceptionally gifted singer of Indian and Western music and hopes that some day she will perform at the Carnegie Hall. Son Ravishankar is an aspiring Engineer cum Computer Scientist. He is a very good violin player and has an excellent ear for music.</i></font></p> <p><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times"><i><b>Music training and early compositions: </b></i></font><i><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="2">Aditya had no musical training until 1989 when he began taking Piano lessons from Verna Abe. He also learned Music Theory from Professor Helen Brown at Purdue University. He took to music composition in 1989. His first major work was an arrangement of a folk melody from India into a piece in three movements. Almost at the same time he wrote and set to music a Bye Bye Song for his niece and nephew visiting the family over Christmas. He wrote music using the Delux Music Construction Set (DMCS) by Electronic Arts on an Amiga 2000 located in his home studio. DMCS also played back the music via MIDI and his first synth module...the Roland Sound Canvas (SC55). Subsequently, Aditya expanded his studio to add more electronic devices and replaced the Amiga by a Mac II Ci. The Ci was replaced by an Si and so on until a dual processor G4 based Mac. On the Mac Aditya uses Finale 2002 to notate his music. He has a lot of music on his mind.; notating it is Aditya's way of getting it out into the world.</font></i></p> <p><font color="#000066"><i><b>Aditya's musical style and later compositions: </b></i></font><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="2"><i>Aditya's music is usually a blend of elements of Indian and Western classical styles and instruments. For example, </i></font><i><font color="#cc0066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="2">Polymodal Fun on a Fibonacci Pyramid,</font><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="2"> uses North Indian modes Khamaaj and Todi in a simulteneous rendition of two supporting melodies.

The </font><font color="#cc0066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="2">Welcome Song</font><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="2"> combines the Indian Sitar with the traditionally Western Strings, French Horn, and Tuba to accompany a melody in the North Indian Raga Yaman Kalyan. </font><font color="#cc0066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="2">A Little Fantasy </font><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="2">written for solo piano was inspired by a North Indian classical melody in Raga Bhopali.

The song </font><font color="#cc0066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="2">In the Bright Summer Morning</font><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="2"> uses Bhairav, a morning Raga. </font><font color="#cc0066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="2">Mhari Gayyan Khul Khul Jaye</font><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="2"> uses a variety of western isntruments to accompany a rustic melody switching between the North Indian modes Bilaval, Kalyan, and Bhairavi.

Given a situation, he can rapidly write text to depict that situation and simulateneously set it to music. He can also quickly set any existing text to music. He has over a dozen songs composed but never written out fully for lack of time. Records of these songs can be found in his music diaries. Though his spontaneous compositions are usually in Raga Yaman Kalyan, he has used Bageshwari, Bhairav, Bhairavi, Bilaval, Malkauns, and Shivranjani to compose fine melodies.</font></i></p> <p><font color="#000066"><i><b>Aditya's poetry: </b></i></font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" color="#000066"><i>This is Aditya's second love...next only to music composition. He has been writing poetry since an early age. The earliest poem that survives was written in 1965 in a winter camp perhaps in collaboration with a close friend. Aditya writes text as plain poem or as text for a song. When he writes text for a song, the melody and text usually develop almost simultaneously. Like his music, Aditya's poetry is inspired by people, events, and nature.&nbsp;</i></font></p> <p><font color="#000066"><i><b>Publications and performances:</b></i></font><font color="#000066" size="2"><i><b> </b></i></font><font color="#000066" size="2"><i>N</i></font><font color="#000066" face="Times New Roman,Georgia,Times" size="2"><i>one of Aditya's music has ever been published.
