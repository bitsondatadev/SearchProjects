A natural extension of the relational model is the <i>logical</i> model, which gives rise to systems known as deductive database systems. Another way of thinking of deductive database management systems is as an extension of the logic programming concept of languages like PROLOG. (While PROLOG has a "small-world" view, deductive database management systems embody a "large-world" view) To better understand about PROLOG and its declarative nature, we need to review propositional logic, predicate logic and the resolution method of theorem proving.</P> The second part of the lecture focused on the step beyond "conventional" deductive database systems. Rather than creating systems that can prove or verify theorems, we wish to perform "mining" to generate potential theorems. The technique to achieve this is called (obviously!) "inductive logic programming" (ILP). The phrase "logic programming" emphasizes that the representation language used to perform data mining is the first order predicate logic. The word "inductive" emphasizes that the way to determine new concept definitions is by induction, i.e., by way of labeled positive and negative examples of the concept. Thus ILP can be considered to be a very natural extension of traditional deductive database systems. Currently, ILP products have not found mainstream acceptance into database management systems; though these will not be long in coming. An example of an ILP system is PROGOL which implements "inverse resolution", which as the name indicates includes a generalization step to aid in the determination of novel concepts. </ul> <BR> <BR> </P> <HR NOSHADE SIZE=2> </P> <A HREF="../index.html"><IMG SRC="../images/returnhome.gif" ALT="Return Home" BORDER=0></A> </BODY></HTML> </BODY></HTML>
