The amount of time required varies with the course but you <i>may not generate overtime charges for the department </i>without the prior authorization by W. J. Gorman (wjg@cs) in writing or by e-mail. Overtime pay is required when an employee works more than 40 hours in a week or more than eight hours in a day <i>for the University</i>.</p> <p style="margin-top: 1">3.

Gorman in writing or by e-mail. </p> <p style="margin-top: 1">4. <i>You must report all conflicts of interest</i> in writing or by e-mail to your supervisor and to W. J. Gorman promptly. In particular, if you are aware that a roommate, friend, relative, or business associate of yours or any other person of particular interest to you is in the course, you must make that known.&nbsp; (&quot;Course&quot; includes all sections that are in any way coordinated.) Your supervisor will attempt to arrange your duties to avoid opportunities for wrongdoing. This serves for the protection of all parties involved.</p> <p style="margin-top: 1">Failure to disclose a conflict is a serious breach of ethics and a basis for both termination and disciplinary action.</p> <p style="margin-top: 1">5.
