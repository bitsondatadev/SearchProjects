Ask around: cancer is not uncommon and many people have a story to tell that might contain a helpful pointer.</blockquote> <h3><a href="cancer1.htm">Prostate Cancer</a></h3> <h3><a href="cancer2.htm">Cancer of the Pancreas</a></h3> <h3>Other Links</h3> <blockquote> <a href="http://www.cancerlinksusa.com/prostate/">Prostate Cancer (Cancer Information Network)</a><br> <a href="http://www.PanCAN.org">Pancreatic Cancer Action Network</a> <br> <a href="http://www.craigscause.ca">Craig's Cause Pancreatic Cancer Society</a><br> <a href="http://www.pancreatica.org/milo.html">Web site for long-term pancreatic cancer survivors</a><br> <a href="http://www.asbestos.com/">A mesothelioma website</a><br> <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/">Search for clinical trials</a><br> <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/">National Cancer Institute</a><br> <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/">Web site to search for drugs etc.</a> </blockquote> <hr> Last updated July 2008 <hr> </body> </html>
