In the past, the law has imposed legal responsibility for technology designs when products pose threats to physical safety (e.g., airbags to protect drivers when accidents occur). In recent years, the entertainment industry has proposed that developers of information technologies do and should have legal responsibility for economic harms resulting from misuse of technologies, such as copyright infringement. <br> <br> Although the Supreme Court in the MGM v. Grokster decision did not agree with MGM about liability premised on technology design, it did say that technology design could be taken into account when lower courts consider whether Grokster and Streamcast induced user infringements. In particular, the Court mentioned the failure to install filters to block infringing files as a possibly relevant factor. This talk will consider whether or under what circumstances the law should impose legal responsibility on technology developers based on design decisions.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">BIO:<br> Pamela Samuelson is a Professor at the University of California at Berkeley with a joint appointment in the School of Law and School of Information Management and Systems.
