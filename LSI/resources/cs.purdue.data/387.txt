As part of that work, he is currently publishing TENPACK, an LAPACK-based software library for the computer manipulation of tensor products of matrices. Professor Dyksen's work in mathematical software has expanded to include interactive graphical user interfaces, most notably windowing systems. He has given invited presentations at conferences and companies around the world on the design and implementation of X Window System-based software systems. <p> <a href="../publications/wrd.html">Recent Publications</a> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/wrd"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
