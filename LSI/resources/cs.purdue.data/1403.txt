<title> Solving ELLPACK </title> <H1>Solving Elliptic Problems Using ELLPACK</H1> <P> <h2>John R. Rice and Ronald F. Boisvert</h2> <P> <h3> <A HREF = "http://www.springer-ny.com">Springer Verlag</A>, 1984, 497 pages</h3> <HR> <h4>Part 1: User's Guide</h4> <P> A complete user's guide and reference. There are many examples including several complex ones showing how ELLPACK can be used to solve elliptic problems, simultaneous equations and problems with interfaces. <h4>Part 2: The ELLPACK Modules</h4> <P> Capsule descriptions of the 50 plus problem solving modules along with a substantial overview of the ITPACK software for solving large sparse systems of linear algebraic equations using iteration. <h4>Part 3: The Performance of ELLPACK Software</h4> <P> Basic information on the time, memory and accuracy of ELLPACK modules to solve a set of model problems; provides insight into choosing a method for a particular application. <h4>Part 4: Contributor's Guide</h4> <P> Complete information on how to prepare a new module for inclusion in ELLPACK, also useful for those doing advanced applications. <h4>Part 5: Systems Programmer's Guide</h4> <P> Information about how to install ELLPACK as it is, plus information on how to tailor ELLPACK to a particular class of applications. <h4>Appendices:</h4> <OL TYPE=A> <LI> The PDE Population <LI> The PG (Preprocessor Generator) System <LI> The Template Processor <LI> Examples of ELLPACK Statements </OL> <HR> <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/jrr"> John Rice's Home Page </a> <HR> <a href="ellpack.html"> ELLPACK Home Page </a> <HR> <P> <a href="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/"><img align+bottom src="/images/homeButtonSm.gif"></A> Purdue University Department of Computer Sciences Sciences
