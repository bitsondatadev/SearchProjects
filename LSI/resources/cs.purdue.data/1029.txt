Due to the data sizes involved, efficient techniques for fast retrieval are required. One way to speed up the search is to apply filtration methods, which work in two phases: a fast scanning phase searches for potential matches which are verified by a slower but accurate checking phase. <p> The use of q-grams, i.e., substrings of length q, as a filter is based on the fact that each approximate match must resemble the searched pattern. This resemblance can be observed in the filtration phase as preserved q-grams of the searched pattern. <p> The use of the q-gram approach in approximate pattern matching results in various filtration methods. For example, one can utilize the fact that the preserved q-grams retain their original order. The variations differ from each other for example in the frequency of false matches they yield. A false match is a potential match which is falsified in the checking phase. <p> Besides practical algorithms, the q-gram approach provides researchers with a particular challenge: the algorithm analysis problems due to overlapping q-grams. <P> <FONT COLOR="#ce9c33" SIZE="-1"> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/ar98" TARGET="_top"> <CENTER> 1998 <BR> Annual Research Report</A> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu" TARGET="_top">Department of <BR> Computer Sciences</A> </CENTER> </FONT> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
