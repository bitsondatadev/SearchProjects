Panda, The Ohio State University &lt;<A HREF="mailto:panda@cis.ohio-state.edu">panda@cis.ohio-state.edu</A>&gt; <P> <STRONG>ABSTRACT:</STRONG><BR> This tutorial is intended to provide an in-depth overview of the emerging InfiniBand Architecture (IBA) standard. This new architecture incorporates high performance I/O in addition to interprocessor communication, provides QoS and protection in the network, provides multiple transport services, and allows flexibility of IBA subnets to be connected to Wide Area Networks (WANs) through routers. The IBA standard incorporates many of the Virtual Interface Architecture (VIA) functions at its verbs layer. The tutorial will demonstrate how high performance communication and I/O architectures for scalable systems can be designed with this standard by taking into account interprocessor communication, network communication, and communication to I/O devices. The basic components of the IBA standard and multiple layers of this architecture will be described in detail. The differences between IBA and other on-going developments and standardization effort such as PCI-X, iSCSI, Rapid I/O, Hyper-transport, 3GIO, TCP off-load engines (TOE), etc. will be highlighted. We will show how the IBA standard facilitates the next generation servers and data-centers to be designed not only to deliver high performance but also RAS (Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability). Open research challenges in designing communication and I/O subsystems of these systems with IBA will be outlined. The tutorial will conclude with an overview of on-going IBA related research projects, IBA products, and the market time frame for the IBA products. <P> Outline:<UL> <LI> Introduction <LI> What is InfiniBand Architecture (IBA)? <LI> Overview of IBA <LI> Details of IBA Architecture <LI> How is it Different from Other Technologies? <LI> Unique Features and Benefits <LI> Performance Comparison with Competing interconnects <LI> Overview of On-going IBA Research <LI> Overview of IBA Products and Time frame <LI> Conclusions </UL> <P> Intended Audience:<BR> This tutorial is intended for researchers, scientists, engineers, managers, developers, professors, and students engaged in research, design, and development of next generation communication and I/O architecture for enterprise servers and data centers as well as high-performance and scalable systems. <P> <STRONG>SPEAKER BIOGRAPHY:</STRONG><BR> Dhabaleswar K.

Sterbenz and Joseph D. Touch, John Wiley, 2001. The target audience includes computer scientists and engineers who may have expertise in a narrow aspect of high-speed networking (such as switch design), but want to gain a broader understanding of all aspects of high-speed networking and the impact that their designs have on overall network performance. This tutorial is not about any particular protocols and standards, but is rather a systemic and systematic approach to the principles that guide the research and design of high-speed networks, protocols, and applications. <P> The network is a complex system of systems, and high-speed networking does not result from the design of individual components or protocols in isolation. Thus, this tutorial presents a systemic approach to high-speed networks, where the goal is to provide high bandwidth and low latency to distributed applications, and to deal with the high bandwidth-x-delay product that results from high-speed networking over long distances. A set of fundamental axioms is presented (Know the past present and future, Application primacy, High-performance paths, Limiting constraints, and Systemic optimisation), followed by the major topics:<UL> <LI> Network architecture and topology <LI> Network control and signalling <LI> Communication links <LI> Switches and routers <LI> End systems <LI> End-to-end protocols <LI> Networked applications </UL> A set of design principles are defined and applied to each of the topics:<OL> <LI> Selective optimisation <LI> Resource tradeoffs <LI> End-to-end arguments <LI> Protocol layering <LI> State management <LI> Control mechanism latency <LI> Distributed data <LI> Protocol data unit structure </OL> A set of design techniques (scaling time and space, masking the speed of light, specialised hardware implementation, parallelism and pipelining, data structure optimisation, cut-through and remapping) are introduced and applied as appropriate. <P> <STRONG>SPEAKER BIOGRAPHY:</STRONG><BR> Dr. James P.G.

In general, routes between nodes in an ad hoc network may include multiple hops. Due to the potential ease of deployment, many practical applications have been conceived for ad hoc networks, including personal area networking, home networking, search-and-rescue operations, and battlefield applications. When designing mobile ad hoc networks, several interesting and difficult problems arise due to shared nature of the wireless medium, limited transmission range of wireless devices, node mobility, and battery limitations. This tutorial will present an overview of issues related to medium access control (MAC) and routing in mobile ad hoc networks. Several techniques proposed to improve performance of MAC and routing protocols will be discussed. The tutorial will include a discussion of approaches for reducing energy consumption by nodes in a mobile ad hoc network. <P> <STRONG>SPEAKER BIOGRAPHY:</STRONG><BR> Nitin Vaidya received Ph.D. from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
