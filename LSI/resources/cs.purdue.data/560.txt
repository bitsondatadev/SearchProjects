Panorama also performs interprocedural analysis for data allocation and task scheduling on distributed shared-memory multiprocessors (DSM). Zhiyuan Li collaborates with a group at University of Minnesota to build the Agassiz C compiler for a future generation of microprocessors which can speculatively execute parallel threads on multiple thread units. His group has also built architecture simulators which are integrated with compilers to study the impact of compiler optimizations and paging schemes on the performance of DSM. <P> Zhiyuan Li received an NSF Research Initiation Award and an NSF CAREER Award in 1992 and 1995 respectively. <P> <i>Projects:</i> <ul> <li> Panorama Fortran compiler <li> Agassiz C compiler </ul> <P> <A HREF="../publications/li.html">Recent Publications</a> <P> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/li"> Personal Homepage</A><P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
