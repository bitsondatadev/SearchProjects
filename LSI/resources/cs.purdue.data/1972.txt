Components can be commercially available off the shelf (COTS) or developed in-house or contractually. In either case, the following problems are faced by a developer of a system based on one or more components: <ol> <li> Selection for reuse and testing of components. <li> Testing a system or subsystem based on components. <li> Evaluating the impact of component failure on the subsystem or system. </ol> <P> This project is aimed at addressing each of the above three problems. Our research involves development of a test methodology directed at problems (1) and (2) above and a methodology for the assessment of fault tolerance, directed at problem (3) above. We use a tool named Proteum/IM in our experimentation. Proteum/IM was developed by Professor Jose Maldonado and Dr. Marcio Delamaro of the University of Sao Paulo at Sao Carlos in Brazil. We are enhancing a tool named TAMER for the assessment of fault tolerance in the presence of COTS. <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
