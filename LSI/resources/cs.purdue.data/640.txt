He has been a crusader for the use of code coverage criteria in the estimation of software reliability or as an orthogonal metric to assess confidence in the reliability estimates. He has proposed the &quot;Saturation Effect&quot; as a motivating device for the use of a sequence of testing techniques. This device is often used by vendors to enhance marketing of their test tools. Mathur's recent work deals with test and management of Internet services. His research group has developed homeWabash, a tool for the management of networked devices. He is also investigating the use of feedback control theory for the control of software development processes.</font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Professor Mathur </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">received his college education from the Birla Institute of Technology and Science (known as BITS) located in Pilani in the state of Rajasthan, India, where he acquired his Bachelors, Masters, and Doctoral degrees in 1970, 1972, and 1977, respectively, in Electrical Engineering. In 1973, with a few colleagues, he established a computer science department at BITS. From 1983 until 1985, he was the Head of this department. In 1985 he moved to Georgia Tech, coming to the Department of Computer Sciences at Purdue as a Visiting Associate Professor in 1987. In 1989, he became Associate Professor. He served as Director of Software Engineering Research Center (SERC) from 1995 to 2001. In August of 1996 he was promoted to Professor. He served as Associate Head of the Department of Computer Sciences from 1997 to 2001. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From the years 1998 to 2001, he was the Chair of the CS Graduate Committee and also Chaired the Graduate Admissions Committee from 1999 to 2001. </font></p> <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Congratulations Professor Mathur! </font> </p> </div> </td> </tr> </table> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
