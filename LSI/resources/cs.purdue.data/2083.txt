Hoffmann</A><P> Sponsors: ONR, NSF<P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> <P> In this research all major aspects of geometric and solid modeling systems are investigated; for example, how to choose suitable representations of objects, how to efficiently implement design operations, and how to drive automatically specific surface elements from very high-level specifications. We are developing a high-level geometry representation that is feature-based and constraint-based. Ease of design and redesign are the main focus of the work, and we are developing a new architecture for CAD systems. The project maintains informal research ties with a number of related efforts both within and outside the department.<P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
