<html> <body> <pre> Important note: Please do not come to me because you need the two points to get from a B to an A. If I have made a genuine mistake (and you need to show me that I have made a mistake), I would be happy to change your scores (and if as a consequence your grade changes, I would be happy to do that as well). There will always be someone right under the cutoff for a grade. It is the nature of the system we live in. I will be unavailable the rest of this week. If you would like to discuss your grade, please make an appointment with me (by email) for monday or tuesday morning. Thank you and I hope you have a wonderful summer. Notes: Grading policy: 15% project, 25% homework, 25% midterm, 35% final.
