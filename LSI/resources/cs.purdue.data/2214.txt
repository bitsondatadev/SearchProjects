<HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE> Errata for Computer Networks And Internets </TITLE> </HEAD> <BODY> <H2> Computer Networks And Internets Fifth Edition </H2> <BR> <NL> Page 54 <UL> The general form of a URL should show a question mark as the delimiter for parameters rather than a percent sign. For more information on URL syntax, see RFC 3986. </UL> Page 57 <UL> The acronym JPEG is incorrectly expanded; it should be the Joint Photographic Experts Group. </UL> Page 124 <UL> Figure 7.9 incorrectly skips MHz, which means that the arrows labeled GHz and THz are positioned incorrectly. <BR><BR> Figure 7.10 incorrectly labels frequencies in Mbps instead of MHz. </UL> Page 127 <UL> The satellites in 7.13 should be farther from the earth by an amount equal to the earth's radius. </UL> Page 147 <UL> It may not be clear that the division in Figure 8.12 is performed modulo 2; additional text is needed preceding the example to explain that the division does not use conventional arithmetic. </UL> Page 174 <UL> In the footnote, the word "public" is missing the letter "l". </UL> Page 216 <UL> Exercise 12.5 is incorrectly worded. It should ask which forms of DSL are used for each of the cases where more data is sent or received. </UL> Page 235 <UL> The first paragraph under ``Byte And Bit Stuffing'' says that in ASCII, a f2SOHf1 has hexadecimakl value 201 and f2EOTf1 has hexadecimal value 204. Although many networks use the high-order bit to indicate control chactacters, the ASCII definintion specifies hexadecimal 0x01 and 0x04. </UL> Page 262 <UL> In Figure 15.7, the diagram of twisted pair Ethernet wiring should show wires running from each computer down the hall to the hub. </UL> Page 297 <UL> Figure 17.4 shows the bridge learning that C is on segment 1 even though C has not transmitted a packet. In addition, the heading "Frame Sent" is changed to "Frame Travels" to indicate that the bridge does not send the frame back over the segment on which it arrived. </UL> Page 351 <UL> "...only four bits of " => "only six bits" <BR> "...the ISP can divided" => "...the ISP can divide" <BR> In Figure 21.4 the first 24 bits should be 0 through 23, not 0 through 24. </UL> Page 357 <UL> Added a footnote describing the use of all-zeroes in a default route along with an explanation that the use is unrelated to the interpretation when used in a datagram. </UL> Page 397 <UL> Removed block 169.254.0.0/16 from the figure, and Clarified that although the block is reserved for link-local assignments, it is not generally used for NAT. </UL> Page 399 <UL> The translation table in Figure 23.13 incorrectly lists the destination IP address in incoming packets; the address should be 128.10.24.6. </UL> Page 435 <UL> Labels of "already acknowledged" and "already sent" are reversed. </UL> Page 580 <UL> The version of the web server code in the text does not support the file name "index.html" as used in the example on page 575. An extra test should be added to recognize "/index.html" as well as "/". </UL> <BR> <BR> <BR> <H3> Copy of corrected pages: </H3> <UL> <A HREF="cnai/page-54.pdf">View page 54 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-57.pdf">View page 57 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-124.pdf">View page 124 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-127.pdf">View page 127 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-147.pdf">View page 147 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-174.pdf">View page 174 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-216.pdf">View page 216 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-235.pdf">View page 235 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-262.pdf">View page 262 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-297.pdf">View page 297 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-351.pdf">View page 351 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-357.pdf">View page 357 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-397.pdf">View page 397 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-399.pdf">View page 399 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-435.pdf">View page 435 in pdf</A> <BR> <A HREF="cnai/page-580.pdf">View page 580 in pdf</A> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> </UL> <BR> <H4><A HREF="netbooks.html#cnai">Return to list of Comer's networking books</A></H4> <BR> <H4><A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/comer">Return to Comer's homepage</A></H4> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
