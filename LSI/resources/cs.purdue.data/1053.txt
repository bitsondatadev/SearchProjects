The goal of the interrogation is to bring to the user a deeper understanding of the data as well as the underlying physical laws and properties. We are working on various notions of the structure of multidimensional sampled data, for application to the computation of error-bounded reduced detail meshes supporting valid combinatorial, metric and topological queries. In addition, we research new data structures and associated visualization techniques to enable efficient quantitative querying of the underlying domain geometry and associated scalar, vector or tensor fields <A HREF="../research/shastra/projects/visualization/shaviz.html"> http://www.cs.purdue.edu/research/shastra/projects/visualization/shaviz.html</A>. <P> <IMG SRC="goldRule.gif" width =100%> </BODY> </HTML> </HTML>
