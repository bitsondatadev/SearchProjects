It will not deal with one specific topic but rather on several database topics. The topics will be a mix of mature topics (something old) where round balls are polished, novel topics (something new) where we gaze through a crystal ball, old issues that deserve another look in a new light (something borrowed). The seminar will also differ in that it will not be based on reading papers and discussing them. It will not be based on presentations given solely by graduate students, visitors or yours truly. Rather, it will be a combination of all of these.</p> <strong>Something old</strong><br> <p align="justify">A representative set of mature topics will be: Privacy in Databases, Record linkage and data quality, The OS/DB interplay, The IR/DB interplay including ranked query processing, limitations of existing database models, systems and architectures.</p> <strong>Something new</strong><br> <p align="justify">A representative set of speculative topics will be: The relationship of privacy to record linkage, phenomenon and event based information systems including the mining of streams, bioinformatics, probabilistic and fuzzy query processing, experiential databases (as coined by Ramesh Jain), perceptual databases.</p> <strong>Something borrowed</strong><br> <p align="justify">Further, we look at some old topics that don’t ever seem to be fully solved: data sharing and integration, indexing, security and mis-use of information, spatial data processing, database tuning and optimization, in-memory data handling, security.</p> <H2>Details:</H2> <UL> <LI> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/ake/cs590a/syllabus.html">Class Syllabus </A> </LI> </UL> <H2>For Your Interests:</H2> <UL> <LI> <A HREF="http://www.cs.purdue.edu/icds/">Indiana Center for Database Systems </A> </LI> </UL> <HR> </body> </html> </html>
